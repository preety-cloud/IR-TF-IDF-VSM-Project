Access to Periodical Resources .A Palmour, V.E. The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate, and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language. .X 10	12	10 145	1	10 167	1	10 190	1	10 225	1	10 232	1	10 244	1	10 304	1	10 305	1	10 306	1	10 358	1	10 385	1	10 394	1	10 400	1	10 433	1	10 459	1	10 534	1	10 541	1	10 551	2	10 702	1	10 731	1	10 732	1	10 788	1	10 817	1	10 820	1	10 823	1	10 825	1	10 826	1	10 827	1	10 828	1	10 831	1	10 881	1	10 886	1	10 887	1	10 919	1	10 920	1	10 921	1	10 942	1	10 947	2	10 948	1	10 1017	1	10 1058	2	10 1059	1	10 1060	1	10 1146	1	10 1227	1	10 1230	1	10 1257	1	10 1258	2	10 1302	1	10 1305	1	10 1306	1	10 1390	6	10 1390	6	10
