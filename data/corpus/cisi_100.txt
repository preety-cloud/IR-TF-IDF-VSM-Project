Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science .A Merton, R.K. We can only guess what historians of the future will say about the condition of present-day sociology.  But it seems safe to anticipate one of their observations. When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history - as they well might, for this clan of historians promises to go on forever - they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists (and historians) of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.  They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival.  They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled. .X 48	1	100 89	1	100 95	1	100 98	1	100 100	7	100 102	1	100 106	1	100 107	2	100 108	1	100 111	1	100 113	1	100 314	1	100 343	1	100 359	1	100 386	1	100 475	1	100 544	1	100 545	1	100 602	1	100 1062	1	100 1083	1	100 1085	1	100 1187	1	100 1285	1	100 1288	1	100 1291	1	100 1296	1	100 1300	1	100 1301	1	100 1302	1	100 1312	1	100 1313	1	100 1337	1	100 1338	1	100 1345	1	100 1386	3	100 1386	3	100
