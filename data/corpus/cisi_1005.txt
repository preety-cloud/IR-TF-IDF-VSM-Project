Library Response to Urban Change; a study of the Chicago Public Library .A Martin, L.A. This is the third in a series of studies of the Chicago Public Library, spread over fifty years.  The first (A Library Plan for the Whole City, adopted in 1916) proposed expansion, particularly in branch units. The second (A Metropolitan Library in Action, completed in 1939) proposed quality, the achieving of recognized standards.  The underlying theme of the present report is adaptability, the restructuring of the Library in a period of change. The first report, practical and pragmatic, achieved results.  The second,for all its internal excellence, had limited effect.  It is hoped that the present effort partakes both of the relevance of the one and of the integrity of the other. .X 22	1	1005 206	1	1005 207	1	1005 208	2	1005 239	2	1005 245	1	1005 266	1	1005 277	1	1005 282	1	1005 358	4	1005 385	1	1005 408	1	1005 896	1	1005 908	1	1005 925	1	1005 946	2	1005 957	1	1005 959	1	1005 962	1	1005 964	1	1005 976	1	1005 1005	15	1005 1018	4	1005 1032	1	1005 1056	4	1005 1145	2	1005 1149	1	1005 1203	1	1005 1227	1	1005 1240	1	1005 1333	1	1005 1384	1	1005 1400	1	1005 1400	1	1005
