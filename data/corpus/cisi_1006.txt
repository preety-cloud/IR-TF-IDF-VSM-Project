Library Service to the Disadvantaged .A Brown, E.F. This volume is intended mainly as a source book for project and program ideas for libraries now engaged in working with the disadvantaged or planning to do so.  It is also hoped that it will give an overview of the progress to date in work with the disadvantaged by bringing together much of the thinking and many of the ideas that have appeared in literature or in conferences in the last few years. .X 272	1	1006 376	1	1006 910	1	1006 935	1	1006 1006	5	1006 1049	1	1006 1145	1	1006 1227	1	1006 1384	1	1006 1396	1	1006 1396	1	1006
