Library Systems Analysis Guidelines .A Chapman, E.a. This book aims primarily to provide guidelines for library administrators and library systems analysts in analyzing and evaluating existing operating systems and in designing new or improved ones.  In addition, we have found the material to be very useful in staff training programs conducted to ensure knowledgeable staff participation and cooperation in a systems study.  This guide is also adaptable for introducing library school students to the concepts of systems study in the library. .X 114	1	1007 177	1	1007 178	2	1007 206	1	1007 208	1	1007 245	1	1007 249	1	1007 287	2	1007 291	1	1007 293	1	1007 348	1	1007 406	3	1007 408	5	1007 849	1	1007 897	1	1007 916	2	1007 925	1	1007 959	1	1007 960	1	1007 962	1	1007 970	1	1007 976	1	1007 979	1	1007 1007	11	1007 1033	1	1007 1317	2	1007 1358	1	1007 1400	2	1007 1400	2	1007
