The Measurement and Evaluation of Reference Service .A Rothstein, S. The measurement and evaluation of reference service has been more often discussed than attempted.  In fact, the literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized literature of review. Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and cataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little agreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an integral part of reference work because many reference librarians are responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books and libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The preparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus "reference librarian" does, how can one readily determine the effectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a problem, but it is undeniably a big one. .X 274	1	1008 298	1	1008 303	1	1008 353	1	1008 364	1	1008 470	2	1008 1008	7	1008 1017	2	1008 1049	2	1008 1247	1	1008 1263	1	1008 1353	1	1008 1357	1	1008 1357	1	1008
