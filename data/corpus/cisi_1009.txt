Service to Industry and Research Parks by College and University Libraries .A Nicholson, N.N. The phrase "research parks" in the title of this article recalls Eugene B. Jackson's 1961 prediction:  In 1980 there will be universally-managed and industry-sponsored special libraries in the vicinity of the principal universities.  Their advanced use of new methods of bibliographic control, information retrieval, and data exchange will make their operations indistinguishable from those of special libraries of outstanding profit-making organizations in the same subject fields . . . Significant assessments will be made on the participating organization in research parts not only for the financing of day-to-day operations of facilities, especially set up for their benefit, but also for the total enrichment of the university library resources. .X 31	1	1009 36	1	1009 41	1	1009 46	1	1009 181	1	1009 182	1	1009 183	1	1009 184	1	1009 193	1	1009 195	1	1009 198	1	1009 201	1	1009 269	1	1009 340	1	1009 395	1	1009 415	1	1009 431	1	1009 760	1	1009 767	1	1009 774	1	1009 778	1	1009 891	1	1009 905	1	1009 939	1	1009 942	1	1009 952	1	1009 953	1	1009 955	1	1009 964	1	1009 968	1	1009 1009	5	1009 1018	1	1009 1019	1	1009 1240	1	1009 1354	1	1009 1359	1	1009 1390	1	1009 1397	1	1009 1417	1	1009 1424	1	1009 1424	1	1009
