The Science Citation Index: A New Concept in Indexing .A Malin, M.V. The purpose of this paper is to discuss citation indexing and its present application as exemplified by the Science Citation Index, published by the Institute for Scientific Information as a new, unique, and necessary tool for scientific work.  It is necessary, therefore, to describe briefly, and in general terms, the nature of conventional subject indexing systems in order that a basis for contrast between these and citation indexing can be obtained.  For those who wish to read extensively on the subject of indexing, references are provided at the end of the paper under the section "Additional References." .X 39	1	1010 41	1	1010 347	1	1010 355	1	1010 560	1	1010 588	1	1010 602	1	1010 618	1	1010 632	1	1010 676	1	1010 718	1	1010 719	1	1010 793	1	1010 1010	5	1010 1044	1	1010 1082	1	1010 1086	1	1010 1087	1	1010 1277	1	1010 1283	2	1010 1285	1	1010 1287	1	1010 1290	1	1010 1300	1	1010 1302	1	1010 1347	1	1010 1444	1	1010 1444	1	1010
