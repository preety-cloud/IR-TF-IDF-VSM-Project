Information Network Prospects in the United States .A Becker, J. Unmistakable signs are pointing the way toward the creation sometime soon of a national information network in the United States.  The concept of a national network implies the interconnection of existing information systems and libraries through communications.  Certainly one of the great strengths of this nation is the great array of intellectual, scholarly, and research resources to be found in its libraries and information centers. Without integration and close cooperation, however, these resources will remain a series of separate, insulated institutions.  But if maximum communication can be established among them, this array can be converted into a national resource of immense value to citizens throughout the country. .X 24	2	1011 74	1	1011 75	2	1011 78	1	1011 80	1	1011 119	4	1011 122	3	1011 177	1	1011 178	1	1011 206	1	1011 281	1	1011 336	3	1011 431	1	1011 481	1	1011 654	1	1011 684	1	1011 773	1	1011 850	1	1011 851	1	1011 852	1	1011 853	1	1011 854	1	1011 855	3	1011 856	1	1011 872	1	1011 903	1	1011 907	1	1011 908	1	1011 955	2	1011 984	1	1011 1011	11	1011 1013	1	1011 1080	2	1011 1247	1	1011 1451	1	1011 1451	1	1011
