The Microform Revolution .A Stevens, R.E. Librarians have tried replacing some of their books and journal files with microfilm copies or other microforms in order to save valuable space in the bookstacks, instead of or in addition to extension of the stack area, decentralization, compact shelving, separate storage warehouse, or any of the other solutions to the storage problem discussed in earlier chapters.  As a final paper, this solution for the storage of library materials will be discussed.  Although the distinct forms will not often be designated, "microform" is used here to mean the four forms most common in the United States: 35 mm. roll microfilm, microfiche (now standardized in the United States and Great Britain at 4 by 6 inches) and the two micro-opaque forms - 3 by 5 inch Microcard, and 6 by 9 inch Microprint. .X 286	2	1014 383	2	1014 672	2	1014 721	2	1014 724	1	1014 1014	5	1014 1059	1	1014 1268	1	1014 1352	1	1014 1352	1	1014
