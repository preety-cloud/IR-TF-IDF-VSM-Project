Evaluation of Adult Reference Service .A Weech, T.L. The evaluation of reference service has received considerable attention in the literature over a comparatively long period.  But, as Samuel Rothstein pointed out in his 1964 Library Trends article on the measurement and evaluation of reference service, much of the literature has focused on discussing the lack of evaluation or the shortcomings of the evaluation that has taken place.  In the ten years since Rothstein wrote his article, there does seem to be more effort at evaluation of reference service.  Undoubtedly, many of the trends in recent evaluation are due to the influence of Rothstein's article. .X 10	1	1017 190	1	1017 225	1	1017 234	1	1017 244	1	1017 248	1	1017 274	2	1017 304	2	1017 305	1	1017 306	2	1017 338	1	1017 358	1	1017 385	1	1017 394	1	1017 433	1	1017 459	1	1017 534	1	1017 646	1	1017 647	1	1017 651	1	1017 702	1	1017 731	1	1017 732	1	1017 817	1	1017 820	1	1017 823	1	1017 825	1	1017 826	1	1017 827	1	1017 828	1	1017 910	1	1017 927	1	1017 942	1	1017 943	1	1017 944	1	1017 947	1	1017 948	2	1017 1008	2	1017 1017	8	1017 1049	3	1017 1058	1	1017 1145	1	1017 1146	1	1017 1206	1	1017 1230	1	1017 1237	1	1017 1257	1	1017 1263	1	1017 1357	2	1017 1378	1	1017 1390	1	1017 1440	1	1017 1450	1	1017 1453	1	1017 1453	1	1017
