The Library's Public; a report of the public library inquiry .A Berelson, B. The following report on use of the public library is the product of two separate studies made for the Public Library Inquiry.  One was the national sample survey of library use made for the Inquiry by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan.  Personal interviews of a half-hour or more in length were held with 1,151 people selected at random in different counties scattered over the United States. The sample was designed so as to represent all adult persons living in private households. By this tested method the survey gathered information concerning the amount and the kind of use people make of the public library and what changes or extension of library service people in general would prefer.  The survey also gathered information on the use of books obtained from sources other than the public library, as well as the extent of regular use of newspapers, radio, magazines, and movies. .X 31	1	1018 36	1	1018 41	1	1018 46	1	1018 181	1	1018 182	1	1018 183	1	1018 184	1	1018 193	1	1018 195	1	1018 198	1	1018 201	1	1018 208	1	1018 239	1	1018 269	1	1018 358	2	1018 385	1	1018 395	1	1018 415	1	1018 470	1	1018 760	1	1018 767	1	1018 774	1	1018 778	1	1018 891	1	1018 905	1	1018 925	1	1018 946	2	1018 952	1	1018 953	1	1018 957	1	1018 959	1	1018 962	1	1018 964	1	1018 968	1	1018 1005	4	1018 1009	1	1018 1018	9	1018 1019	1	1018 1032	2	1018 1056	2	1018 1145	1	1018 1149	1	1018 1203	1	1018 1227	1	1018 1240	2	1018 1333	1	1018 1359	1	1018 1380	1	1018 1384	1	1018 1397	1	1018 1417	1	1018 1417	1	1018
