The Subject Specialist in National and University Libraries, with Special Reference to Book Selection .A Danton, J.P. Of the world's numerous kinds of libraries, the national and the university may properly be characterized as having responsibilities for both general and universal or nearly universal collecting in the realm of scholarship.  That is, these two, and only these two, commonly collect over a very broad spectrum, and in depth, material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge. Herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it be granted, as it is here assumed, that almost no field of human endeavor can advance without resort to the recorded past.  It is this twin aspect of the activity of these scholarly libraries - collecting simultaneously in breadth and in depth - which produces most of their major problems.  The concern of this paper is with two of these problems which seem by far the most important and difficult: the selection of materials and the utilization of subject specialists. .X 11	1	1021 143	1	1021 268	4	1021 303	1	1021 305	1	1021 843	1	1021 923	1	1021 943	1	1021 985	2	1021 1020	1	1021 1021	8	1021 1023	1	1021 1058	1	1021 1450	1	1021 1450	1	1021
