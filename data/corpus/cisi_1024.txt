PRECIS in a Multilingual Context .A Austin, D. The present paper is offered as the first of a series of articles in which PRECIS will be reviewed as a potential multi-lingual system, having in mind the obvious need, notably in a European context, for standard and language- independent methods of subject analysis and document description.  This first paper outlines the origins of PRECIS, and considers its use in English- Language indexing.  A second paper will deal in general terms with the syntactical model which is used for producing PRECIS input strings and index entries.  Later papers will then review the application of this model to indexing in, firstly, the Germanic languages (e.g. German and Danish), and, secondly, the Romance languages, illustrated by French. .X 1	1	1024 86	1	1024 92	1	1024 168	1	1024 194	1	1024 458	1	1024 480	1	1024 556	1	1024 781	1	1024 817	1	1024 819	1	1024 825	2	1024 1004	1	1024 1024	6	1024 1027	1	1024 1054	1	1024 1215	5	1024 1231	1	1024 1443	1	1024 1443	1	1024
