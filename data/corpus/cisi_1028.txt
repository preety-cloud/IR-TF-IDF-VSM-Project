A List of Books for College Libraries .A Shaw, C.B. To permit a qualitative estimate of a college library's resources, the Advisory Group on College Libraries of the Carnegie Corporation authorized the compilation of a list of not less that 8,000 nor more than 15,000 titles which might be regarded as a statement of the minimum or basic book collection of a four-year liberal arts college. The procedure on which the Advisory Group decided included (1) the selection of a librarian under whose direction the compilation should be made, (2) the checking and improvement of the original lists drawn up by this compiler by such a homogeneous group as the faculty of a single college, and (3) the submission of these revised recommendations to an able group of widely scattered college teachers for further revision. .X 7	1	1028 14	1	1028 153	1	1028 170	1	1028 223	1	1028 240	1	1028 262	1	1028 266	1	1028 271	1	1028 405	1	1028 550	1	1028 926	1	1028 927	1	1028 1019	1	1028 1028	5	1028 1086	1	1028 1090	1	1028 1211	1	1028 1212	1	1028 1266	1	1028 1424	2	1028 1424	2	1028
