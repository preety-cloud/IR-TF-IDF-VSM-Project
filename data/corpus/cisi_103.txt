Nobel Laureates in Science: Patterns of Productivity, Collaboration, and Authorship .A Zuckerman, Harriet Nobel laureates in science publish more and are more apt to collaborate than a matched sample of scientists.. Interviews with 41 of 55 laureates and comparison of their research output with the output of the matched sample indicate that these patterns hold at every stage of the life-work-cycle.. As laureates report and as their publications collaborate, they exercise noblesse oblige in arranging co-authorship in collaborative publications.. Receipt of the Nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work practices, as a result of changed role obligations and activities.. Reductions in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already eminent.. The prize generates strain in collaborative associations so that most of these terminate soon after the award.. .X 15	1	103 19	1	103 32	2	103 37	1	103 39	1	103 40	1	103 47	1	103 88	3	103 97	1	103 102	2	103 103	8	103 104	1	103 108	1	103 111	1	103 112	1	103 113	1	103 170	1	103 233	1	103 253	1	103 313	1	103 359	1	103 377	1	103 379	1	103 395	1	103 475	1	103 505	1	103 560	1	103 573	1	103 592	1	103 618	1	103 632	1	103 635	1	103 667	1	103 748	2	103 749	1	103 751	1	103 764	1	103 765	1	103 777	1	103 778	1	103 782	1	103 791	1	103 793	1	103 804	1	103 805	1	103 893	3	103 952	1	103 1016	1	103 1061	1	103 1085	2	103 1086	1	103 1087	1	103 1182	1	103 1200	1	103 1274	1	103 1277	1	103 1278	1	103 1280	1	103 1287	1	103 1291	1	103 1301	1	103 1302	1	103 1304	1	103 1313	1	103 1334	1	103 1335	1	103 1338	1	103 1339	1	103 1341	1	103 1342	1	103 1343	1	103 1344	2	103 1347	2	103 1380	1	103 1428	1	103 1444	1	103 1444	1	103
