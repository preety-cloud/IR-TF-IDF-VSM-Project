Londoner and His Library .A Groombridge, B. This report deals with a complementary theme: the public for which the public library service is provided.  It does this in two ways - by giving information about the nature of that public, as it is at present made up, and by reporting what people say about public libraries, not only those who are members, but also those who used to belong and those who never have.  Its closest relatives in British writing on this subject are, therefore, Mass Observation's now dated Reading in Tottenham (1947) and the Society of Young Publishers' Survey Books in London, 1959.  It is more comprehensive in scope and more detailed in its analysis that the Tottenham survey, while it goes in some depth into issues that necessarily played only a small part in Books in London. .X 239	2	1032 358	1	1032 456	2	1032 470	1	1032 925	1	1032 946	1	1032 1005	1	1032 1018	2	1032 1032	7	1032 1056	3	1032 1145	1	1032 1227	1	1032 1238	1	1032 1240	1	1032 1380	1	1032 1380	1	1032
