Visibility and the Structural Bases of Awareness of Scientific Research .A Cole, Stephen .A Cole, Jonathan R. The paper contains an analysis of several aspects of the communication process in science.. Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires mailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of a scientists' work are studied.. Four strong determinates of visibility were found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which the scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see.. This latter characteristic is called "awareness"..The data indicate that awareness is high in all sectors of the population studied.. Variables such as age, rank of department, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness.. We conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently.. .X 33	1	104 48	2	104 76	1	104 95	1	104 102	2	104 103	1	104 104	5	104 106	2	104 108	2	104 110	2	104 111	1	104 112	1	104 113	2	104 161	1	104 170	2	104 456	1	104 545	1	104 560	1	104 582	1	104 584	1	104 589	1	104 655	1	104 793	1	104 893	1	104 1062	1	104 1274	1	104 1285	2	104 1286	1	104 1287	3	104 1291	2	104 1297	1	104 1300	1	104 1304	1	104 1313	1	104 1334	1	104 1338	1	104 1340	1	104 1341	1	104 1342	1	104 1343	1	104 1344	2	104 1346	2	104 1347	1	104 1347	1	104
