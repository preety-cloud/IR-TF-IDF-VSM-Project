The Managerial Grid .A Blake, R.R. The Managerial Grid method of designating various styles of leadership avoids these semantic traps.  Even more, it shows how a leader can simultaneously maximize both the methods which are production-oriented and those which are people-oriented.  Thus instead of putting a manager in a dilemma of choosing one or the other alternative, it illustrates that there are ways he can gain the benefits of both.  It puts various methods of managing problems into a framework where the leader can identify, study and change his own behavior.  Thus he is in a position to understand it better, to evaluate the results it produces, and to encourage its use by others. .X 293	1	1041 298	1	1041 304	1	1041 312	1	1041 356	1	1041 401	1	1041 418	1	1041 436	1	1041 437	1	1041 1036	1	1041 1041	6	1041 1069	1	1041 1154	2	1041 1187	1	1041 1188	1	1041 1233	1	1041 1333	1	1041 1406	1	1041 1455	1	1041 1455	1	1041
