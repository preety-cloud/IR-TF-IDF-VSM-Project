The Marc II Format: A Communications Format for Bibliographic Data .A Avram, H.D. The MARC (Machine-Readable-Cataloging) Pilot Project was an experiment to test the feasibility of distributing Library of Congress cataloging in machine-readable form to a variety of users.  This project grew out of the conviction of many librarians that automation was becoming necessary if libraries were to keep up with the rising tide of new materials and the mounting demand for rapid information.  Although there were other library procedures which stood to profit from mechanization, it was felt that devising a method of recording bibliographical information in machine-readable form was basic to the solution of other problems. .X 59	1	1042 63	1	1042 64	1	1042 175	2	1042 218	1	1042 243	1	1042 245	1	1042 253	1	1042 265	1	1042 355	1	1042 374	1	1042 375	1	1042 408	1	1042 481	1	1042 482	1	1042 492	1	1042 497	1	1042 506	1	1042 507	1	1042 508	1	1042 510	1	1042 548	1	1042 594	1	1042 601	1	1042 604	1	1042 607	1	1042 717	2	1042 718	1	1042 719	1	1042 781	1	1042 783	1	1042 834	1	1042 835	1	1042 848	1	1042 849	1	1042 850	1	1042 851	1	1042 852	1	1042 864	1	1042 866	1	1042 867	1	1042 873	1	1042 922	1	1042 925	1	1042 980	1	1042 981	1	1042 982	1	1042 1012	1	1042 1042	7	1042 1043	1	1042 1051	2	1042 1087	1	1042 1252	1	1042 1327	1	1042 1410	1	1042 1415	2	1042 1426	1	1042 1426	1	1042
