The MARC Pilot Project: The Final Report .A Avram, H.D. The MARC project has progressed from a pilot to test the feasibility of a distribution service of centrally produced machine-readable cataloging data to a full-scale operational system in the design stages in two short years. The library community, both here and abroad, has accepted MARC and recognizes its potential for the future.  The single most significant result of MARC has been the impetus to set standards.  There is no doubt that eventually standards would have been designed for machine-readable bibliographic records, character sets, and codes for place and language.  MARC accelerated standardization and still more important, the standards are being set and agreed to be a large segment of the library community. The cooperation among the producers and users of bibliographic description has been a rewarding experience. .X 159	1	1043 178	1	1043 249	2	1043 852	1	1043 854	1	1043 857	1	1043 858	1	1043 859	1	1043 861	1	1043 930	1	1043 970	1	1043 1012	1	1043 1042	1	1043 1043	5	1043 1252	3	1043 1393	1	1043 1393	1	1043
