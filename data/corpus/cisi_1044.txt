Mathematical Taxonomy .A Jardine, N. In this book we give a mathematical account of some of the methods of data simplification which are involved in or suggested by the practice of biological taxonomy.  The computable methods derived are offered as potentially useful tools for taxonomists, rather than as substitutes for their activities. Superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of classificatory systems:  biological taxonomy, ecology, psychology, linguistics, archaeology, sociology, etc.  But more detailed examination shows that the kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based differ widely from science to science.  Whilst we recognize that some of the methods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are more widely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biological taxonomy.  The emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under which their application is valid, so that anyone who wishes to apply the methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations, and of the lines along which they may profitably be developed and modified. .X 39	1	1044 175	7	1044 176	1	1044 327	1	1044 389	2	1044 390	2	1044 416	1	1044 422	2	1044 458	1	1044 498	1	1044 509	3	1044 560	1	1044 562	1	1044 564	1	1044 566	1	1044 570	1	1044 602	1	1044 618	1	1044 632	1	1044 643	1	1044 644	1	1044 660	1	1044 670	1	1044 699	1	1044 700	1	1044 708	1	1044 737	1	1044 752	1	1044 754	1	1044 785	1	1044 829	1	1044 1010	1	1044 1044	12	1044 1082	1	1044 1092	1	1044 1154	1	1044 1202	1	1044 1218	3	1044 1300	1	1044 1327	4	1044 1444	1	1044 1444	1	1044
