The Mathematical Theory of Communication .A Shannon, C.E. The word communication will be used here in a very broad sense to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another.  This, of course, involves not only written and oral speech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theatre, the ballet, and in fact all human behavior.  In some connections it may be desirable to use a still broader definition of communication, namely, one which would include the procedures by means of which one mechanism (say automatic equipment to track an airplane and to compute its probably future positions) affects another mechanism (say a guided missile chasing this airplane). The language of this memorandum will often appear to refer to the special, but still very broad and important, field of the communication of speech; but practically everything said applies equally as well to music of any sort, and to still or moving pictures, as in television. .X 20	1	1045 29	1	1045 34	1	1045 35	1	1045 42	2	1045 43	1	1045 53	1	1045 58	1	1045 60	1	1045 70	1	1045 84	1	1045 85	3	1045 95	1	1045 129	1	1045 137	1	1045 168	1	1045 172	1	1045 175	2	1045 312	1	1045 355	1	1045 382	1	1045 444	1	1045 445	1	1045 447	1	1045 449	1	1045 456	1	1045 457	1	1045 459	1	1045 469	1	1045 474	1	1045 486	1	1045 532	1	1045 572	1	1045 574	1	1045 585	1	1045 590	1	1045 599	1	1045 625	1	1045 640	1	1045 652	1	1045 660	1	1045 665	3	1045 716	1	1045 762	2	1045 764	1	1045 803	1	1045 893	1	1045 1016	1	1045 1022	1	1045 1030	2	1045 1037	2	1045 1045	23	1045 1046	1	1045 1047	1	1045 1054	1	1045 1077	1	1045 1084	1	1045 1116	1	1045 1161	1	1045 1195	1	1045 1201	2	1045 1204	1	1045 1213	1	1045 1220	1	1045 1235	1	1045 1268	1	1045 1281	1	1045 1285	1	1045 1296	1	1045 1327	2	1045 1389	1	1045 1422	1	1045 1443	1	1045 1443	1	1045
