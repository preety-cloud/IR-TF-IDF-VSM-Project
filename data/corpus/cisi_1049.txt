Measuring the Quality of Library Service:  A Handbook .A Beeler, M.G. There is probably no measurement task which public servants face which is more difficult than that of measuring the quality of service.  It is as difficult to measure the quality of hospital service, or of schools, or of social welfare programs, as it is to determine the quality of library service.  It is equally as difficult to decide what actions to take in order to improve service. Legislators, urban and regional planners, consultants, boards of trustees, accrediting teams, librarians, and a host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some conclusions about the quality of service offered by library systems.  This handbook is intended for these groups, and especially for practicing librarians.  The pervasiveness of the problem across all public service institutions, however, leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to other groups. .X 234	1	1049 274	1	1049 304	1	1049 306	1	1049 338	1	1049 376	1	1049 646	1	1049 647	1	1049 651	1	1049 910	1	1049 935	1	1049 942	1	1049 943	1	1049 944	1	1049 948	1	1049 1006	1	1049 1008	2	1049 1017	3	1049 1049	5	1049 1145	1	1049 1206	1	1049 1227	1	1049 1237	1	1049 1357	1	1049 1378	1	1049 1384	1	1049 1396	1	1049 1440	1	1049 1450	1	1049 1453	1	1049 1453	1	1049
