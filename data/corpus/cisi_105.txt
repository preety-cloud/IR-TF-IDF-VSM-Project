Social Structure in a Group of Scientists: A Test of the "Invisible College" Hypothesis .A Crane, Diana The existence of social organization within a research area may be inferred (a) if scientists who have published in the area have more social ties with one another than with scientists who have not published, and (b) scientists who have published in the area can be differentiated by degree od social participation within the area.. Using the mail questionnaire, sociometric data on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists, all of whom had published in a particular problem area.. Respondents chose scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists within the area.. Analysis of direct and indirect ties, using Cleman's method for analysis of sociometric connectedness, revealed that a tie with one or more of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less productivity into a large network of influence and communication.. Similarities between this type of social organization and that of the "social circle" are discussed.. .X 15	2	105 33	1	105 41	1	105 50	1	105 89	3	105 95	1	105 98	1	105 101	1	105 102	2	105 105	14	105 109	1	105 110	1	105 111	1	105 113	2	105 155	1	105 157	1	105 161	1	105 163	1	105 233	1	105 243	1	105 308	1	105 312	1	105 314	1	105 356	3	105 386	1	105 398	1	105 473	1	105 544	4	105 545	1	105 560	6	105 582	1	105 592	1	105 602	1	105 605	1	105 607	1	105 656	1	105 667	1	105 685	1	105 750	1	105 775	1	105 800	1	105 893	1	105 1030	4	105 1048	1	105 1050	1	105 1062	1	105 1063	4	105 1081	1	105 1082	1	105 1088	1	105 1111	1	105 1186	1	105 1188	1	105 1235	1	105 1256	1	105 1284	2	105 1285	3	105 1286	1	105 1287	2	105 1290	1	105 1291	2	105 1293	3	105 1294	1	105 1295	1	105 1296	3	105 1297	1	105 1298	1	105 1300	2	105 1308	1	105 1312	1	105 1315	1	105 1319	1	105 1329	2	105 1334	1	105 1339	1	105 1341	1	105 1346	3	105 1347	1	105 1386	3	105 1387	3	105 1389	1	105 1408	2	105 1408	2	105
