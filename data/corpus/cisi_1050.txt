Medical Innovation: a diffusion study .A Coleman, J.S. The research reported here constitutes a case study in the acceptance of an innovation.  The innovation is a medical one, a drug which physicians use in everyday practice; the setting is in the Midwestern United States in the 1950's.  This study gives a glimpse of one small part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its allied institutions. But more generally, the question of the spread of an innovation is of interest to all students of society.  Particularly in an age of change, and in our complex and massive society, an understanding of the way in which an innovation can spread - for better or worse! - constitutes important knowledge of man.  It is to aid in this understanding, as well as to describe the case at hand, that this report is written. .X 89	2	1050 102	1	1050 105	1	1050 109	1	1050 110	1	1050 137	1	1050 139	1	1050 147	1	1050 155	1	1050 157	1	1050 210	1	1050 312	1	1050 314	1	1050 355	1	1050 356	3	1050 391	3	1050 426	1	1050 436	3	1050 437	2	1050 544	1	1050 560	1	1050 582	1	1050 656	1	1050 658	2	1050 685	1	1050 763	1	1050 788	1	1050 986	1	1050 1030	1	1050 1050	7	1050 1062	1	1050 1254	1	1050 1256	1	1050 1284	1	1050 1285	1	1050 1288	2	1050 1290	1	1050 1291	2	1050 1293	1	1050 1294	1	1050 1295	1	1050 1296	2	1050 1297	1	1050 1319	1	1050 1339	1	1050 1346	1	1050 1386	2	1050 1404	1	1050 1404	1	1050
