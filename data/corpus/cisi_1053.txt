Methods of Information Handling .A Bourne, C.P. This book is meant to be an aid and reference work for those people who are interested in the design of information systems.  Such information systems are typified by the traditional libraries, but the same problems of information processing, storage, and retrieval are present in many government and industrial organizations in many places besides the library.  This book provides an illustration of the tools, equipment, and methodology that might be applied to those problems. .X 140	1	1053 146	1	1053 337	1	1053 346	1	1053 360	1	1053 458	1	1053 471	1	1053 495	1	1053 563	1	1053 835	1	1053 851	1	1053 862	1	1053 911	1	1053 966	1	1053 967	1	1053 1053	6	1053 1231	1	1053 1309	1	1053 1393	1	1053 1393	1	1053
