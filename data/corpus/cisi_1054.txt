Relevance Predictability in Information Retrieval Systems .A Kent, A. Belzer, J. Kurfeerst, M. Dym, E.D. Shirey, d.L. Bose, A. An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli used to represent documents in information retrieval systems.  In effect, since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon the examination of one "level of processing" of the document (e.g., the citation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties of what constitutes "relevance".  However, prior to such an analysis, an even more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions of a document should be examined. An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs), functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents by motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled experimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate response products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph, last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be representative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and abstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that: 1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document; 2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs; 3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and 4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not substantive. Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous work with unmotivated subjects. .X 35	2	1054 42	1	1054 43	1	1054 52	1	1054 58	1	1054 70	1	1054 73	1	1054 81	1	1054 86	1	1054 95	1	1054 194	1	1054 420	1	1054 451	1	1054 480	1	1054 571	1	1054 578	1	1054 582	1	1054 589	1	1054 594	1	1054 595	1	1054 655	1	1054 656	1	1054 657	2	1054 712	1	1054 781	1	1054 785	1	1054 817	1	1054 825	1	1054 1024	1	1054 1045	1	1054 1054	5	1054 1154	1	1054 1215	1	1054 1232	1	1054 1281	1	1054 1295	1	1054 1298	1	1054 1298	1	1054
