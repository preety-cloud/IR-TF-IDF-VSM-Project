The Use of Biomedical Periodical Literature at the National Lending Library for Science and Technology .A Wood, D.N. Bower, C.A. The paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the use of biomedical periodical literature carried out at the UK National Lending Library in February 1969.  The survey was designated to discover the subject, date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the most frequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of references to biomedical publications. The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issues involved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand was less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests were for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biological literature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8 per cent) involved English language periodicals. Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literature were citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recent literature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primary sources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the most used indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents. .X 2	1	1055 33	1	1055 36	1	1055 41	1	1055 65	1	1055 75	1	1055 76	3	1055 89	2	1055 97	1	1055 102	1	1055 111	1	1055 112	1	1055 132	1	1055 137	1	1055 139	1	1055 152	1	1055 155	1	1055 156	1	1055 163	1	1055 183	3	1055 184	2	1055 193	2	1055 195	1	1055 198	1	1055 199	1	1055 201	1	1055 203	2	1055 204	2	1055 210	3	1055 213	1	1055 214	1	1055 225	1	1055 269	1	1055 359	1	1055 373	1	1055 382	1	1055 475	1	1055 495	1	1055 526	1	1055 545	1	1055 552	3	1055 587	1	1055 605	1	1055 613	1	1055 614	1	1055 638	1	1055 676	1	1055 735	2	1055 747	1	1055 750	1	1055 753	1	1055 760	1	1055 766	2	1055 767	1	1055 774	1	1055 775	2	1055 779	1	1055 782	1	1055 784	2	1055 788	3	1055 789	2	1055 790	1	1055 793	1	1055 800	1	1055 808	1	1055 828	1	1055 905	1	1055 953	1	1055 977	2	1055 983	1	1055 1016	1	1055 1023	1	1055 1030	1	1055 1055	7	1055 1056	1	1055 1083	1	1055 1086	1	1055 1087	1	1055 1090	1	1055 1135	1	1055 1260	1	1055 1275	1	1055 1276	1	1055 1278	1	1055 1280	1	1055 1281	1	1055 1285	1	1055 1286	1	1055 1287	1	1055 1295	1	1055 1297	1	1055 1302	1	1055 1335	1	1055 1390	1	1055 1397	2	1055 1417	1	1055 1428	1	1055 1432	2	1055 1451	1	1055 1451	1	1055
