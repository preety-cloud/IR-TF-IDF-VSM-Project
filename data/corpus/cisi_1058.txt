User Resistance to Microforms in the Research Library .A Salmon, S.R. Microforms enjoy only limited acceptance in research libraries, largely because of user resistance.  A growing number of published studies indicate that improper production, inadequate bibliographic access, lack of standardization, defects in equipment design, maintenance problems, poor environments for microform usage, and certain inherent characteristics of the microforms themselves all combine to make their use inconvenient. Solutions to most of these problems have existed for some time, but the microform industry has been slow to correct them.  Some positive developments have occurred in the last two years, but the major problems remain. .X 10	2	1058 11	1	1058 143	1	1058 190	1	1058 225	1	1058 232	1	1058 244	1	1058 268	1	1058 286	1	1058 304	1	1058 305	2	1058 306	1	1058 358	1	1058 383	1	1058 385	1	1058 394	1	1058 433	1	1058 459	1	1058 534	1	1058 551	1	1058 702	1	1058 721	1	1058 731	1	1058 732	1	1058 817	1	1058 820	1	1058 823	1	1058 825	1	1058 826	1	1058 827	1	1058 828	1	1058 886	1	1058 887	1	1058 947	1	1058 948	1	1058 1017	1	1058 1020	1	1058 1021	1	1058 1058	6	1058 1059	1	1058 1060	1	1058 1146	1	1058 1230	1	1058 1257	1	1058 1390	1	1058 1390	1	1058
