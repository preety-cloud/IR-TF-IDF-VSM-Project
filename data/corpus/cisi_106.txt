Growth and Decay Curves in Scientific Citations .A MacRae, Duncan Jr. In a rapidly advancing scientific discipline, new contributions will supersede older ones.. This selection in favor of recent literature should be observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines.. .X 33	2	106 39	1	106 41	1	106 47	1	106 48	3	106 100	1	106 102	3	106 104	2	106 106	9	106 108	1	106 110	1	106 111	1	106 112	1	106 113	3	106 170	1	106 314	3	106 377	1	106 456	1	106 545	2	106 560	1	106 587	1	106 605	1	106 632	2	106 667	1	106 750	1	106 764	1	106 767	2	106 793	3	106 794	1	106 800	2	106 1062	1	106 1273	1	106 1274	2	106 1278	1	106 1280	1	106 1285	6	106 1286	1	106 1287	3	106 1291	1	106 1301	1	106 1302	1	106 1312	1	106 1313	2	106 1337	1	106 1338	1	106 1340	1	106 1344	1	106 1346	2	106 1347	1	106 1352	1	106 1386	1	106 1444	1	106 1444	1	106
