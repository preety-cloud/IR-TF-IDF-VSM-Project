Microforms in Libraries .A Diaz, A.T. Why do libraries use microforms?  According to a 1974 survey by a micropublisher, saving space was the reason given by most respondents. Holmes, on the other hand, found, "to acquire materials not otherwise available," as the major reason.  Others include: (1) Instead of binding serials (journals are retained unbound for two to three years after publication, the period of heaviest use, and are then discarded and replaced by microform versions; (2) To preserve deteriorating materials; (3) Easing access to bulky materials such as newspapers; (4) To provide working copies of materials too delicate for continued use such as rare books; (5) to save money - in most cases the cost of an out-of-print set or serial backfile will be substantially less in microform than the cost of a full-size reprint or the cost of the original on the used book market; (6) Ease of acquisition - i.e., acquiring materials which would otherwise be difficult to acquire; (7) Mutilations reduced. .X 10	1	1060 115	1	1060 232	1	1060 393	1	1060 551	1	1060 647	1	1060 651	1	1060 881	1	1060 882	1	1060 886	1	1060 887	1	1060 888	1	1060 904	1	1060 947	1	1060 999	1	1060 1000	1	1060 1001	1	1060 1002	1	1060 1003	1	1060 1004	1	1060 1058	1	1060 1059	3	1060 1060	8	1060 1437	1	1060 1437	1	1060
