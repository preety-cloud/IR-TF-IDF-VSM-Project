Patterns of Evaluation in Science: Institutionalization, Structure and Functions of the Referee System .A Zuckerman, H. Merton, R.K. The referee system in science involves the systematic use of judges to assess the acceptability of manuscripts submitted for publication.  The referee is thus an example of status-judges who are charged with evaluating the quality of role-performance in a social system.  They are found in every institutional sphere.  Other kinds of status-judges include teachers assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers), critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in sports.  Status-judges are integral to any system of social control through their evaluation of role-performance and their allocation of rewards for that performance.  They influence the motivation to maintain or to raise standards of performance. .X 48	1	1062 89	2	1062 98	1	1062 100	1	1062 102	1	1062 104	1	1062 105	1	1062 106	1	1062 107	2	1062 110	3	1062 111	3	1062 112	1	1062 113	1	1062 155	1	1062 157	1	1062 170	1	1062 314	1	1062 356	1	1062 359	1	1062 456	1	1062 544	1	1062 545	1	1062 560	2	1062 582	1	1062 592	1	1062 602	1	1062 656	1	1062 685	1	1062 793	1	1062 1030	2	1062 1050	1	1062 1062	7	1062 1083	1	1062 1085	1	1062 1209	1	1062 1256	1	1062 1284	1	1062 1285	2	1062 1287	1	1062 1290	1	1062 1291	3	1062 1293	2	1062 1294	1	1062 1295	1	1062 1296	2	1062 1297	1	1062 1301	1	1062 1302	2	1062 1319	1	1062 1335	1	1062 1340	1	1062 1344	1	1062 1346	2	1062 1347	1	1062 1386	1	1062 1386	1	1062
