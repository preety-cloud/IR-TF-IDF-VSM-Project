The Development of a Scientific Specialty: The Phage Group and the Origins of Molecular Biology .A Mullins, N.C. This paper analyses the formation of a new discipline, molecular biology, from the development of phage work.  It argues that such social variables as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain phage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Even though persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided to enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though some recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient to account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the competitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecular biology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position, adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and philosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which occur in scientific development. .X 33	1	1063 95	1	1063 98	1	1063 101	2	1063 102	1	1063 105	4	1063 109	1	1063 110	1	1063 343	1	1063 386	1	1063 391	1	1063 398	1	1063 544	2	1063 560	1	1063 605	1	1063 667	1	1063 750	1	1063 775	1	1063 800	1	1063 1030	2	1063 1063	7	1063 1081	1	1063 1082	1	1063 1088	1	1063 1284	1	1063 1285	1	1063 1286	1	1063 1287	1	1063 1300	1	1063 1308	1	1063 1312	1	1063 1315	1	1063 1329	1	1063 1334	1	1063 1342	1	1063 1386	2	1063 1387	2	1063 1389	1	1063 1408	1	1063 1408	1	1063
