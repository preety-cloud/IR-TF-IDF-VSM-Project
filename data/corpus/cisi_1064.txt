Modern Manuscripts  A Practical Manual for Their Management, Care and Use .A Duckett, K.W. The title of this book is intended to indicate that its scope is limited to manuscripts of the seventeenth century to the present.  Examples and techniques are drawn from institutions in the United States with occasional references to practices in Great Britain and Canada.  The book is directed toward the novice curator of manuscripts, and, again, as the title indicates, it is intended to serve as a practical guide, not as an exposition of theory. .X 142	1	1064 1064	6	1064 1064	6	1064
