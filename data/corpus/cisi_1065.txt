Modern Organizations .A Etzione, A. The plan of this book follows our definition of organizations as social units that pursue specific goals which they are structured to serve, obviously under some social circumstances.  Therefore the book has three foci:  organizational goals; organizational structure; and organizations and their social environment.  Considerably more space is devoted to organizational structure than to the other topics, for two reasons:  First, more research has been conducted and more writings are available on organizational structure than on organizational goals (Chapter 2) and environment.  Second, the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed their interests on structural aspects of the organization, and thus, we may best evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational structure. .X 270	1	1065 285	1	1065 301	1	1065 381	1	1065 1015	1	1065 1065	6	1065 1150	1	1065 1333	1	1065 1353	1	1065 1454	1	1065 1454	1	1065
