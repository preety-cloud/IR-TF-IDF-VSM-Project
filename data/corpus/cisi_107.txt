The Structure of Scientific Fields and the Functioning of University Graduate Departments .A Lodahl, Janice Beyer .A Gordon, Gerald Kuhn's concept of paradigm suggests that academic disciplines could be viewed as technologies involving degree of task predictability.. A series of hypotheses were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of communication and access to stored information.. Using questionnaire data collected from 80 university graduate departments, physicists and chemists were found to exhibit more agreement over field content, and to be more willing and satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political scientists.. In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields.. Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines.. .X 33	1	107 89	1	107 95	1	107 98	1	107 100	2	107 107	6	107 110	1	107 111	3	107 112	1	107 113	1	107 155	1	107 308	1	107 359	1	107 386	1	107 544	1	107 602	1	107 1062	2	107 1083	1	107 1085	1	107 1273	1	107 1291	1	107 1296	1	107 1300	2	107 1301	1	107 1302	2	107 1312	1	107 1313	1	107 1315	1	107 1338	1	107 1345	2	107 1347	1	107 1386	1	107 1386	1	107
