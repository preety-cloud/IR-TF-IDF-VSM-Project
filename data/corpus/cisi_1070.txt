The Motivation to Work .A Herzberg, F. This book reports the findings from a study of job motivation based on a fresh approach to this problem.  It is an important study, since the analyses and interpretations of the authors suggest that a breakthrough may well have been made to provide new insights into the nature and method of operation of job attitudes. The senior authors were well prepared for their task, having recently completed a comprehensive review and analysis of the research in this field, reported in Job Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion.  This review of several thousand articles and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much disagreement and confusion in the field.  It appeared that one of the major contributors to this apparent diversity of results was the unstable nature of the subjective data on which studies in this field have been typically based. .X 4	1	1070 128	1	1070 129	1	1070 130	1	1070 167	1	1070 173	1	1070 223	1	1070 225	1	1070 227	1	1070 234	1	1070 280	1	1070 285	1	1070 293	1	1070 296	1	1070 298	1	1070 301	1	1070 302	1	1070 393	1	1070 418	5	1070 468	1	1070 494	1	1070 639	1	1070 646	1	1070 647	1	1070 651	1	1070 765	1	1070 768	1	1070 774	1	1070 818	1	1070 822	1	1070 823	2	1070 827	1	1070 842	1	1070 843	1	1070 844	1	1070 925	2	1070 943	1	1070 944	1	1070 1015	1	1070 1069	3	1070 1070	6	1070 1085	1	1070 1150	2	1070 1186	1	1070 1187	1	1070 1214	2	1070 1233	1	1070 1374	1	1070 1390	1	1070 1401	1	1070 1437	1	1070 1454	1	1070 1455	2	1070 1455	2	1070
