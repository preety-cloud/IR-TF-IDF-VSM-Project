GREMAS - A System for Classification and Documentation in Organic Chemistry .A Fugmann, R. Brann, W. Vanpel, W. The authors of this essay were faced with the task of organizing a documentation office in which a large number of publications and patents in chemistry would have to be processed.  This large collection would be made available to a large group of elements without restrictions. To permit a large frequency of use, and to maintain this also with increases in file sizes, it becomes necessary to limit especially that faction of the task which consists in the retrieval activities paper. Savings in the retrieval activity are possible only at the expense of greater effort in indexing and by heavier use of technical aids.  We have taken the second path by consciously applying the principles	to a highly detailed faceted classification. .X 116	3	1072 117	1	1072 254	1	1072 327	1	1072 490	1	1072 491	1	1072 495	1	1072 512	1	1072 641	1	1072 668	1	1072 670	1	1072 671	1	1072 673	1	1072 677	1	1072 678	1	1072 679	1	1072 682	1	1072 683	1	1072 689	2	1072 690	1	1072 693	1	1072 694	1	1072 695	1	1072 698	1	1072 700	1	1072 704	1	1072 706	1	1072 707	1	1072 727	1	1072 730	1	1072 738	1	1072 833	1	1072 1026	1	1072 1072	6	1072 1292	1	1072 1452	1	1072 1452	1	1072
