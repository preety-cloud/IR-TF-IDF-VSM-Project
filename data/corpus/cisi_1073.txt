Automatic Construction of Thesauri and of Concept Systems for Dictionaries and Subject Lists .A Lang, F.H. After a synopsis of the relations existing between descriptors and their concepts, the EPD-program called "GENTHES" is described.  The program supports the construction of a thesaurus and its use.  The relational system corresponds to ISO/DIS 2788 (UNESCO) and DIN 1463.  It differentiates, however, in addition generically related and contiguous terms pertaining to a part-whole system. Characteristics that determine narrower terms against their broader terms are introduced as new relation.  Many types of associations are made available for experimenting.  The programmed generation of dependent relations reduces the amount of work to one third although ensuring total avoidance of formal errors and logical contradictions, even in applying permitted polyhierarchy.  The program is available in batch mode or in an interactive timesharing version (Remote GENTHES).  The program functions are input, logical and formal input checking, generation of relations, display, delete, print on line printer and storage on disk.  GENTHES is running in Vienna on a System IBM/370. .X 114	1	1073 169	1	1073 289	1	1073 345	1	1073 400	1	1073 459	1	1073 493	1	1073 548	1	1073 627	1	1073 911	1	1073 990	1	1073 1073	5	1073 1231	1	1073 1368	1	1073 1392	1	1073 1414	1	1073 1448	1	1073 1448	1	1073
