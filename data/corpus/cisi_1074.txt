The DK (Decimal Classification) - a Multi-Faceted Classification .A Dahlberg, I. Backed up by numerical data  derived from an ASLIB analysis of the planned world-wide system of UNISIST, the author critically investigates the claimed university of the U.D.C.  According to it, the so-called "Universal Decimal Classification" proves to be fragmentary.  Terminological aspects are not provided for, hierarchical order often is fictitious, and the representation of special fields is inadequate.  For the purpose of reforming the Decimal Classification, a reconstruction scheme is suggested, consisting of free facets, with the aid of which special classifications can be compiled, according to the modular principle. .X 75	1	1074 154	2	1074 477	1	1074 838	2	1074 898	1	1074 989	1	1074 1074	6	1074 1075	3	1074 1077	1	1074 1391	2	1074 1402	2	1074 1413	1	1074 1429	2	1074 1430	2	1074 1430	2	1074
