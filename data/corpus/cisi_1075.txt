Possibilities for Revisions of the DK (Decimal Classification) .A Dahlberg, I. For a number of reasons mentioned it is proposed to reorganize in a new edition the existing UDC completely, to reallocate the subject fields of the UDC main classes according to present day views, state of knowledge and priorities, and to subdivide these main classes only by subfields of subject fields.  The specific facets of each field should be represented by a uniform array of special auxiliaries attached to the fields through the technique of interrupted subdivision.  These should express the following categories: (1) Theory, (2) Objects, (3) Processes, (4) Attributes, (6) Order, organization, (7) Relation, (8) Determination, (9) Evaluation. ((5) is left free for the moment).  Proposals for further simplification of the scheme are outlined regarding the general categories, the symbols used and the rules for syntagmatic organization taking into account the implications of computer technology.  Possible changes in the layout and editions of a new UDC are discussed. .X 75	1	1075 154	2	1075 477	1	1075 838	2	1075 898	1	1075 1074	3	1075 1075	5	1075 1391	2	1075 1402	2	1075 1413	1	1075 1429	2	1075 1430	2	1075 1442	1	1075 1448	1	1075 1448	1	1075
