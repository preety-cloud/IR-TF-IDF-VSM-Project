Comments about Terminology in Documentation. II:  communication and Information .A Wersig, V.G. Meyer-Uhlenried, K. Developing from the definitions of the concept language a terminological represented model of the communication process can be deduced that shows the transfer of meaning between communicator and recipient through communication channels and mediators.  The distinguished communication structures are communication sequences, chains, nets and systems.  With an universal definition of data as fixed representations of facts by means of signs the various meanings of the term "information" are terminological to differentiate as "information," "information process" and "informations." The theory of signs makes the differentiation of syntactical, semantical, sigmatical and pragmatical information possible.  Adequate to communication process and system we can determine informing process and information system. .X 29	1	1077 58	1	1077 60	1	1077 85	1	1077 117	1	1077 165	3	1077 169	1	1077 445	2	1077 451	1	1077 476	1	1077 525	2	1077 590	2	1077 609	1	1077 621	2	1077 641	1	1077 656	1	1077 668	1	1077 670	1	1077 671	1	1077 674	1	1077 683	1	1077 689	2	1077 715	1	1077 762	1	1077 797	1	1077 814	1	1077 819	1	1077 901	1	1077 1022	1	1077 1045	1	1077 1074	1	1077 1077	7	1077 1231	3	1077 1309	1	1077 1309	1	1077
