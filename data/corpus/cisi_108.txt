Productivity Differences among Scientists: Evidence for Accumulative Advantage .A Allison, Paul D. .A Stewart, John A The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity, resources and esteem increases as career age increases.. .X 48	1	108 100	1	108 102	2	108 103	1	108 104	2	108 106	1	108 108	5	108 113	2	108 170	1	108 314	1	108 545	1	108 893	1	108 1274	1	108 1285	1	108 1291	2	108 1301	1	108 1304	1	108 1313	1	108 1334	2	108 1337	2	108 1338	2	108 1341	1	108 1342	2	108 1343	2	108 1344	1	108 1345	1	108 1386	1	108 1386	1	108
