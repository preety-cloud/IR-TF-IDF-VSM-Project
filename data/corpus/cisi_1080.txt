National Document-Handling Systems for Science and Technology .A Carter, L.F. This book has grown out of a study undertaken for the Committee on Scientific and Technical Information (COSATI) Task Group on National Systems(s) for Scientific and Technical Information in support of their examination of national document and information systems.  The emphasis of the study as stated by COSATI is as follows: 1. Initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems relating to scientific and technical documents, their handling and the management of such documents.  Specific matters to be reported on will include, the current organizational and functional situation in the United States; the extent to which known  deficiencies are causing a reduction in the  potential for technical effectiveness in the United States scientific and technical community; the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for correction of these deficiencies; and one or more action plans which can be followed by governmental (especially including Congress) and non-governmental units. 2. Secondary attention will be given to development of programs which can be undertaken with Government support for identifying,  analyzing, and giving a structure to the total flow of scientific and technical information in the United States." .X 119	1	1080 123	1	1080 175	1	1080 206	1	1080 273	1	1080 331	1	1080 336	1	1080 361	1	1080 376	1	1080 459	1	1080 481	1	1080 850	1	1080 872	1	1080 925	1	1080 939	1	1080 940	1	1080 941	1	1080 996	1	1080 1011	2	1080 1080	8	1080 1144	1	1080 1198	1	1080 1258	1	1080 1435	1	1080 1436	1	1080 1441	1	1080 1441	1	1080
