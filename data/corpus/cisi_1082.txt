Mathematical Approach to the Spread of Scientific Ideas - The History of Mast Cell Research .A Goffman, W. One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature of its own growth.  Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right. Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can therefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the given area. The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells.  In his recent comprehensive survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a "full bibliography" in which "every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with."  This bibliography constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of scientific ideas, since it provides us with  all the contributions to the subject area, from Ehrlich's discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963. .X 33	2	1082 36	1	1082 39	1	1082 44	1	1082 48	1	1082 57	2	1082 76	1	1082 81	1	1082 101	1	1082 105	1	1082 144	1	1082 184	1	1082 193	1	1082 195	1	1082 201	1	1082 203	1	1082 204	1	1082 205	1	1082 228	2	1082 229	1	1082 233	2	1082 267	1	1082 359	2	1082 395	1	1082 416	1	1082 471	1	1082 505	1	1082 544	1	1082 560	2	1082 587	1	1082 599	1	1082 602	1	1082 605	1	1082 618	1	1082 631	1	1082 632	1	1082 667	3	1082 724	1	1082 748	2	1082 750	2	1082 751	1	1082 759	2	1082 765	2	1082 767	1	1082 775	1	1082 778	2	1082 784	1	1082 787	2	1082 791	1	1082 792	1	1082 793	1	1082 800	2	1082 803	1	1082 893	1	1082 1010	1	1082 1030	1	1082 1044	1	1082 1063	1	1082 1081	5	1082 1082	12	1082 1083	2	1082 1085	1	1082 1086	1	1082 1088	2	1082 1201	3	1082 1219	1	1082 1227	1	1082 1270	1	1082 1278	1	1082 1285	1	1082 1286	3	1082 1287	2	1082 1290	1	1082 1300	1	1082 1308	1	1082 1312	1	1082 1334	1	1082 1335	1	1082 1338	1	1082 1341	1	1082 1401	1	1082 1417	2	1082 1418	2	1082 1444	2	1082 1444	2	1082
