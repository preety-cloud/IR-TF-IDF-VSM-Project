The Distribution of Social and Cultural Properties in Informal Communication Networks Among Biological Scientists .A Mullins, Nicholas C. Informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible social structure.. This research analyzes the relation of that structure to (1) scientists' descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie those descriptions, (2) social status in science, and (3) the formal social categories of science (i.e. discipline, department, and research organization).. Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network structures.. .X 89	1	109 95	1	109 98	1	109 102	1	109 105	1	109 109	5	109 386	1	109 391	1	109 398	1	109 426	1	109 438	1	109 544	1	109 656	1	109 1050	1	109 1063	1	109 1284	1	109 1296	1	109 1300	2	109 1321	1	109 1339	1	109 1385	1	109 1386	1	109 1408	1	109 1408	1	109
