Library Optimum .A Sandison, A. Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very little experimental evidence on the consistency of either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor is reasonably constant.  But the position of the Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M. Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant. There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no mention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations to that article.  Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again, each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of which he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers. .X 14	1	1090 33	1	1090 36	1	1090 41	2	1090 89	1	1090 97	1	1090 102	1	1090 111	1	1090 112	1	1090 153	1	1090 163	1	1090 170	1	1090 183	1	1090 184	1	1090 193	1	1090 196	1	1090 199	1	1090 203	1	1090 210	1	1090 215	1	1090 219	1	1090 221	1	1090 223	1	1090 225	1	1090 255	1	1090 266	1	1090 269	1	1090 271	1	1090 359	3	1090 373	1	1090 505	1	1090 515	1	1090 545	1	1090 550	1	1090 552	1	1090 573	1	1090 587	1	1090 605	1	1090 613	1	1090 614	3	1090 616	1	1090 638	1	1090 735	1	1090 747	1	1090 748	1	1090 750	1	1090 751	1	1090 753	1	1090 759	1	1090 765	1	1090 766	1	1090 767	1	1090 775	1	1090 778	1	1090 782	1	1090 784	1	1090 788	1	1090 789	1	1090 793	3	1090 800	1	1090 808	2	1090 905	1	1090 953	1	1090 977	1	1090 983	1	1090 1016	2	1090 1019	1	1090 1023	1	1090 1028	1	1090 1030	1	1090 1055	1	1090 1071	1	1090 1083	1	1090 1085	2	1090 1086	2	1090 1087	1	1090 1090	7	1090 1135	1	1090 1147	1	1090 1182	1	1090 1260	1	1090 1275	1	1090 1276	1	1090 1278	1	1090 1280	1	1090 1285	1	1090 1286	1	1090 1287	1	1090 1302	3	1090 1335	1	1090 1352	1	1090 1390	1	1090 1397	1	1090 1417	1	1090 1424	1	1090 1428	1	1090 1432	1	1090 1432	1	1090
