Method for Relating the Structure and  Properties of Chemical Compounds .A Adamson, G.W. The structure diagrams of chemical compounds are widely used in the communication of chemistry.  They are also used in chemical information systems, mainly as keys for the retrieval of associated information.  However some chemical information systems hold property data as well as structure diagrams in machine-readable forms.  If structure-property relationships could be investigated easily within chemical information systems, then the usefulness of the systems would be considerably increased.  Described below are some results which have been obtained during investigation of structure- property relationships using a combination of regression analysis and some techniques of chemical structure handling used in information systems. .X 254	2	1092 327	3	1092 568	4	1092 697	1	1092 700	1	1092 706	1	1092 890	3	1092 1044	1	1092 1092	5	1092 1218	1	1092 1452	1	1092 1452	1	1092
