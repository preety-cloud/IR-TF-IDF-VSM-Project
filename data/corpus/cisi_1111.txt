On Informal Processes of Science Communications .A Markusova, V.A. The paper makes a discussion of major theoretical and experimental studies of the role of informal processes of communication in science..  The author holds that the system of scientific communications is based on formal processes (founded on scientific and technical literature, including the primary and secondary sources), whereas the informal processes (in which scientists play the leading part and which have no institutionalized and permanent interactive mechanisms) are also very important, but auxiliary..  The specific features of the informal processes and their interaction with the formal processes are analyzed in detail.  Recommendations towards efficient use of the positive aspects of informal communications for raising the overall effectiveness of scientific communication system are offered.. .X 105	1	1111 132	1	1111 161	1	1111 166	1	1111 616	1	1111 771	1	1111 808	1	1111 1095	1	1111 1097	1	1111 1102	1	1111 1109	1	1111 1111	5	1111 1114	1	1111 1115	1	1111 1123	1	1111 1125	1	1111 1174	1	1111 1285	1	1111 1355	1	1111 1446	1	1111 1447	1	1111 1447	1	1111
