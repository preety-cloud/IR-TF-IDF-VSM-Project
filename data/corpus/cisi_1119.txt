Axiomatic Relevance Tolerance Theory .A Yakubovich, S. M. Sets are considered on which a symmetric and reflexive relation, called tolerance (similarity) is defined.. The structure of such sets is explored.. A classificatory theorem is proved stating an isomorphism of embedding of such sets in a model space (R).. The properties of particular sets' for which the similarity relation has been defined are investigated.. .X 25	2	1119 455	1	1119 1117	4	1119 1119	5	1119 1137	1	1119 1140	1	1119 1141	1	1119 1409	1	1119 1409	1	1119
