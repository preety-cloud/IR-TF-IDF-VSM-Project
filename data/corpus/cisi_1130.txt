Aspect Abstracting:  A New Technique .A Solovyev, V. I. The new technique has been developed on the basis of an analysis of the present methodological requirements laid to abstracting and a study of textual records as modelling the real world and reflecting the logic of research.. Aspects of meaning have been adopted as the invariant unit characteristics of a document's purport.. Semantic adequacy and semantic equivalence are proposed as criteria to evaluate abstracting precision and exhaustivity.. The aspect-based approach could be likewise applied to indexing of documents and information requests.. If introduced into the practices of information analysis, this technique is expected to raise the standard of abstracts and the efficiency of document-oriented retrieval.. .X 179	1	1130 540	1	1130 1101	1	1130 1116	1	1130 1130	7	1130 1165	4	1130 1195	1	1130 1220	1	1130 1220	1	1130
