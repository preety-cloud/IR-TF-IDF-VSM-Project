Information Retrieval Learning .A Serebryanyi, A. I. The statement of the problem and the results of an experiment in automatic choice of retrieval criterion are described.. The problem of criterion choice is interpreted in terms of a pattern recognition problem.. The criteria chosen as a result of learning are considered, as well as the retrieval noise and losses recorded in searches using these criteria.. The experiments suggest such "limit" noise level which is not liable to any substantial further reduction.. The efficiency of choosing a criterion through learning is discussed.. The relationship between information retrieval learning and nondeductive logic is investigated.. .X 1118	1	1134 1134	6	1134 1135	1	1134 1135	1	1134
