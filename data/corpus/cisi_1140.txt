On the Symbolic Nature of Classifications .A Panova, N. S. Shreider, Yu. A. The nature of an arbitrary classification is considered from the viewpoint of its sign function.. The structure of the taxons described by a given classification is treated as the referent (the denotate).. The formation of taxons is shown to be connected with the preliminary arrangement of the subject area into a classification field.. The classification concept is connected with the structure and nature of the classification characteristics.. A typology of classifications is introduced, distinguishing them by intensionality, or capacity for expression of the concept independent of the subject area.. Differences are pointed out that exist between the classificatory and thematic relationships and the correlations between these two groups of relationships are analyzed.. .X 25	1	1140 179	2	1140 455	1	1140 464	1	1140 509	1	1140 564	1	1140 566	1	1140 853	1	1140 1117	3	1140 1119	1	1140 1137	4	1140 1140	8	1140 1141	3	1140 1220	1	1140 1267	1	1140 1409	1	1140 1409	1	1140
