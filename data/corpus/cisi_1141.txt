Algebra of Classification .A Shreider, Yu. A. Two alternative concepts of isomorphism of classification are examined.. It is shown that with the accuracy of up to isomorphism, the structure of a classification is characterized by a certain semigroup.. For an important type of classifications, the algebraic structure of these semigroups is completely characterized by the relation of order on the set of generants.. The case of "perfect order" on the generants corresponds to hierarchical (tree) classifications.. The case of "incomparability" of the generants corresponds to facet classifications.. All the other cases are "intermediate" between these two types of classification.. .X 25	1	1141 151	1	1141 362	1	1141 455	1	1141 504	1	1141 773	1	1141 798	1	1141 1117	2	1141 1118	1	1141 1119	1	1141 1122	1	1141 1123	1	1141 1133	1	1141 1137	3	1141 1138	1	1141 1140	3	1141 1141	6	1141 1169	1	1141 1220	1	1141 1226	1	1141 1267	1	1141 1409	1	1141 1459	1	1141 1459	1	1141
