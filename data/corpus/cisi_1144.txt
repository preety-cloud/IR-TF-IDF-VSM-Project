Automatic Indexing .A Stevens, M.E. A state-of-the-art survey of automatic indexing systems and experiments has been conducted by the Research Information Center and Advisory Service on Information Processing, Information Technology Division, Institute for Applied Technology, National Bureau of Standards.  Consideration is first given to indexes compiled by or with the aid of machines, including citation indexes.  Automatic derivative indexing is exemplified by key-word-in-context (KWIC) and other word- in-context techniques.  Advantages, disadvantages, and possibilities for modification and improvement are discussed. Experiments in automatic assignment indexing are summarized. Related research efforts in such areas as automatic classification and categorization, computer use of thesauri, statistical association techniques, and linguistic data processing are described.  A major question is that of evaluation, particularly in view of evidence of human inter-indexer inconsistency.  It is concluded that indexes based on words extracted from text are practical for many purposes today, and that automatic assignment indexing and classification experiments show promise for future progress. .X 26	1	1144 38	2	1144 39	1	1144 52	1	1144 77	1	1144 78	1	1144 149	1	1144 150	1	1144 168	1	1144 174	2	1144 175	4	1144 273	1	1144 315	1	1144 324	1	1144 331	1	1144 336	1	1144 382	1	1144 419	1	1144 420	1	1144 455	1	1144 479	1	1144 483	1	1144 485	1	1144 498	1	1144 501	1	1144 503	1	1144 562	1	1144 564	1	1144 565	1	1144 576	1	1144 583	1	1144 586	1	1144 589	2	1144 603	1	1144 608	1	1144 643	1	1144 657	1	1144 660	1	1144 661	1	1144 662	1	1144 663	1	1144 664	1	1144 722	1	1144 769	1	1144 824	1	1144 830	1	1144 925	1	1144 1080	1	1144 1144	12	1144 1195	1	1144 1207	1	1144 1283	1	1144 1294	2	1144 1327	1	1144 1421	1	1144 1421	1	1144
