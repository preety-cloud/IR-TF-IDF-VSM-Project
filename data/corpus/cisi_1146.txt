Networks for Research and Education .A Greenberger, M. Responding to the heightened interest in the possibilities of networks, and reflecting its own continuing interest in improving the use of new technologies in research and education, the National Science Foundation in 1972 announced the mounting of "an expanded research program . . . to explore . . . the resource-sharing potential of a national network in support of research and education."  The NSF was well aware of the obstacles and uncertainties, and it knew that although shareable resources and pockets of relevant information and experience existed, many of the people who should be involved in planning were not currently informed or discussing the possibilities with one another. .X 10	1	1146 124	1	1146 190	1	1146 225	1	1146 244	1	1146 304	1	1146 305	1	1146 306	1	1146 358	1	1146 385	1	1146 394	1	1146 433	1	1146 459	2	1146 530	1	1146 534	1	1146 642	1	1146 643	1	1146 648	1	1146 702	1	1146 731	1	1146 732	1	1146 734	1	1146 736	1	1146 742	1	1146 743	1	1146 817	1	1146 820	1	1146 823	1	1146 824	1	1146 825	2	1146 826	1	1146 827	1	1146 828	1	1146 880	1	1146 883	1	1146 947	1	1146 948	1	1146 1017	1	1146 1058	1	1146 1061	1	1146 1146	6	1146 1215	1	1146 1230	1	1146 1257	1	1146 1374	1	1146 1375	1	1146 1390	1	1146 1441	1	1146 1441	1	1146
