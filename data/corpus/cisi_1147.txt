A Core Medical Library for Practitioners in Community Hospitals .A Stearns, N.S. Ratcliff, W.W. In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate and encourage continuing education programs in community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute (PMI) has determined that there is need for guidance in the area of medical-library development. Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited more than 40 community hospitals indicate that medical-library facilities are generally poor and infrequently used by physicians.  The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist. Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library. Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.  The specialists, chosen from regions throughout the country, were requested to recommend two textbooks and two journals in their area of special interest that they considered to be the most basic and fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It was also requested that recommendations be made in order of preference. .X 41	2	1147 87	2	1147 172	1	1147 189	1	1147 195	1	1147 196	6	1147 198	1	1147 199	1	1147 203	1	1147 211	1	1147 214	1	1147 215	2	1147 216	1	1147 217	1	1147 218	1	1147 219	1	1147 220	1	1147 221	1	1147 359	1	1147 415	5	1147 552	1	1147 891	1	1147 905	1	1147 949	1	1147 1030	1	1147 1071	5	1147 1085	1	1147 1086	1	1147 1090	1	1147 1147	14	1147 1275	1	1147 1302	2	1147 1352	1	1147 1397	1	1147 1397	1	1147
