The New Industrial State .A Galbraith, J.K. During the fifties and sixties it had become customary to depict the economic system of the United States, along with its European and Japanese counterparts, as an accomplishment unique since the Creation.  This volume departed from the accustomed cheering.  It is my impression that the adult reader was always more skeptical than the economists of the neo-Keynesian nirvana.  Economic life was not meant to be that easy.  And perhaps some sensed what I here urge, that what was called success was less what served the individual than what served the goals of great industrial and military bureaucracies which had come, the economic myth notwithstanding, to comprise so large a part of the economic system.  Still, who could tell that a herald of such news would be welcomed - or even heard. .X 22	1	1148 74	1	1148 83	1	1148 169	1	1148 245	1	1148 273	1	1148 279	1	1148 288	1	1148 331	1	1148 381	1	1148 408	1	1148 490	1	1148 496	1	1148 591	1	1148 592	1	1148 723	1	1148 724	1	1148 834	1	1148 860	1	1148 925	1	1148 957	1	1148 976	1	1148 1148	6	1148 1227	3	1148 1317	1	1148 1336	1	1148 1353	1	1148 1359	1	1148 1360	1	1148 1400	1	1148 1406	1	1148 1410	1	1148 1424	1	1148 1424	1	1148
