Analysis of Library User Circulation Requirements .A Trueswell, Richard W. This research study is concerned with the use of the last circulation date as a statistic to help describe library user circulation requirements.. Some decision rules were developed to use this parameter as an aid in determining the number of copies of books to be held in the library and as an aid in the weeding of books from the library's holdings.. The effect of these decision rules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations are described.. The method of data collection is described in detail and is applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems.. Cumulative distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries and a public library were prepared and have been plotted for both circulation data and stack holding data.. This same data has also been plotted by subdivided subject category.. Circulation operating characteristics were prepared for all three libraries.. .X 5	1	115 46	1	115 115	8	115 183	1	115 192	1	115 196	1	115 215	1	115 219	1	115 221	1	115 234	2	115 236	1	115 245	1	115 303	1	115 364	1	115 365	1	115 393	1	115 415	1	115 433	1	115 647	1	115 651	1	115 764	1	115 811	1	115 816	1	115 818	1	115 823	1	115 842	1	115 885	1	115 925	1	115 943	1	115 944	3	115 947	1	115 948	1	115 983	1	115 1023	1	115 1059	1	115 1060	1	115 1071	1	115 1203	1	115 1257	1	115 1302	1	115 1417	1	115 1450	1	115 1450	1	115
