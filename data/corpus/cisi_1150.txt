New Patterns of Management .A Mityaev, V.A. This volume is intended for persons concerned with the problems of organizing human resources and activity.  It is written especially for those who are actively engaged in management and supervision and for students of administration and organization.  It presents a new theory of organization based on the management principles and practices of the managers; who are achieving the best results in American business and government.  It draws also upon research done in voluntary organizations. To maintain a relatively consistent orientation, the focus of this volume is largely on the problems of business enterprises.
