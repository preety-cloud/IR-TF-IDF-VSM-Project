Unintentional Duplication of Research A survey revealing instances of belated discovery of information in the literature leads to an estimate of what duplication costs .A Martyn, J. In a letter in New Scientist (vol. 19, p. 148) the rate of duplication of research among scientists was said to have been estimated at about 10 per cent.  The first systematic attempt to assess the size of this problem, carried out by the Aslib Research Department, suggests the actual figure is more than double this, and the consequent cost to the nation to be measurable in millions of pounds. We put questions to 647 scientists engaged in industrial, academic or government research, including chemists, physicists, biologists, psychologists and mathematicians.  One question was: "Have you, during your current research, discovered in the literature information which you wish you had had at the beginning of your project?"  To this, 144 of them (22 per cent) replied that they had.  Many had made more than one such find, so that the total number of instances was 245. .X 2	1	1151 32	1	1151 33	1	1151 36	1	1151 40	1	1151 83	1	1151 90	1	1151 147	1	1151 150	1	1151 161	1	1151 183	1	1151 184	1	1151 193	1	1151 199	1	1151 201	1	1151 202	1	1151 203	1	1151 204	1	1151 205	1	1151 209	1	1151 212	1	1151 217	1	1151 220	1	1151 222	1	1151 284	1	1151 286	1	1151 294	1	1151 369	1	1151 382	1	1151 465	1	1151 543	1	1151 588	1	1151 613	1	1151 624	1	1151 717	1	1151 771	1	1151 782	1	1151 799	1	1151 800	1	1151 808	1	1151 959	1	1151 1068	1	1151 1089	1	1151 1151	9	1151 1361	1	1151 1361	1	1151
