Non-book Materials: The Organization of Integrated Collections .A Weihs, J.R. .B 1970 This book presupposes a knowledge of book cataloguing and basic cataloguing principles.  The Dewey decimal classification 9th abridged edition, Sears list of subject headings 9th edition, and A list of Canadian subject headings together with a form of simplified cataloguing found in many school libraries have been used on the sample cards.  It must be emphasized that the subject analysis systems chosen by a particular library for its print collection should be used for all media.  Because of its school library orientation, this book distinguishes between essential and optional elements on the catalogue card. Libraries which require detailed cataloguing will consistently list these options, and may wish to augment the description of materials in the collation and in the notes.  Items necessary for a minimum description and for a complete description will be subject to further study prior to the next edition of this work. .X 16	1	1152 63	1	1152 175	1	1152 231	1	1152 235	2	1152 250	1	1152 289	1	1152 348	1	1152 352	1	1152 383	1	1152 389	1	1152 390	1	1152 404	1	1152 487	1	1152 502	1	1152 579	1	1152 596	1	1152 600	1	1152 601	2	1152 799	1	1152 805	1	1152 807	1	1152 848	1	1152 863	2	1152 864	2	1152 897	1	1152 911	1	1152 956	1	1152 963	1	1152 987	1	1152 988	1	1152 989	1	1152 995	1	1152 1152	8	1152 1153	1	1152 1265	1	1152 1294	1	1152 1327	1	1152 1392	1	1152 1392	1	1152
