Formulation of Information Requests .A Venediktov, Y.P. Sokolov, A.V. This article presents the results of a study of the information requests of inquirers. It was elucidated that engineers spent an average of 10 hours per week in search of needed information. Most valuable sources of information are theoretical journals. The study showed that "stable life" of theoretical journals equals about 12 years and information journals about 5-6 years. Some recommendations were formulated on how to construct a reference information collection. .X 372	1	1156 539	1	1156 763	1	1156 772	1	1156 1095	4	1156 1096	2	1156 1099	2	1156 1103	1	1156 1105	1	1156 1155	4	1156 1156	6	1156 1158	3	1156 1160	2	1156 1166	1	1156 1166	1	1156
