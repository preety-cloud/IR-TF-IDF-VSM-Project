Methodological problems of scientific-technical literature typology .A Feldblyum, I.S. Two causes for inconsistency between a primary document is content and form are examined. 1) Inconsistency between document structure and structure of its information. 2) Insufficient development of theories of scientific, and technical literature, in particular, the typology of primary scientific documents. It is suggested that the concept of genres of scientific-technical literature be introduced, based on the degree to which the material is generalized. Five basic genres are examined:  technical reports, articles, monographs, text- books and reference works. The practical application of a typology of scientific and technological literature is shown to be possible. .X 40	1	1160 763	1	1160 772	1	1160 1095	2	1160 1096	1	1160 1098	1	1160 1099	1	1160 1105	1	1160 1110	1	1160 1155	2	1160 1156	2	1160 1158	1	1160 1160	13	1160 1166	1	1160 1168	1	1160 1169	1	1160 1173	1	1160 1174	1	1160 1177	5	1160 1181	1	1160 1191	1	1160 1446	1	1160 1447	2	1160 1447	2	1160
