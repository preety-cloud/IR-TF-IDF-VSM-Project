A Probability Distribution in Information Flow Systems .A Kazachkov, L. S. Khursin, L. A. The paper treats the probability distribution in information flow systems, and presents the analysis of a statistical distribution model called the "hyperbolic ladder" and of the consequences following from this model which were revealed in linguistics (Zipf), theory of scientific information (Bradford), and in science of science (Lotka), etc.. The identity of the mathematical essence of various distributions, investigated by many authors on their own objects of study, is shown.. The link is considered between the basic probability distribution and some problems studied in the modern mathematical theory of information.. Examples are presented of the use of distribution regularities in various systems analysis.. .X 31	1	1173 44	1	1173 48	1	1173 62	1	1173 201	1	1173 359	3	1173 361	1	1173 373	1	1173 379	1	1173 416	1	1173 475	1	1173 748	1	1173 759	1	1173 765	1	1173 778	2	1173 893	1	1173 1019	1	1173 1109	2	1173 1114	1	1173 1122	2	1173 1123	1	1173 1125	1	1173 1160	1	1173 1168	1	1173 1172	1	1173 1173	10	1173 1177	1	1173 1179	1	1173 1182	1	1173 1200	1	1173 1203	1	1173 1226	1	1173 1226	1	1173
