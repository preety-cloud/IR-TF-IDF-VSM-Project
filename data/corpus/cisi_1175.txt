Syntagmatic Relations Between Descriptors .A Chernyi, A.I. Syntagmatic relations (SR) are defined as connections between words that are established aposteriori and combine these words into phrases and sentences.. The lack of means for recording SR in descriptor languages results in a reduction of retrieval precision.. At present, roles and links and the evaluation of the extent to which these devices are used are the major devices used for the description of SR between descriptors in documents' search patterns.. An analysis of published results of experiments testing the performance of roles and links in 176 descriptor retrieval systems operative in the USA suggests the conclusion about a poor performance of roles as a precision device:  an increase of 10 percent in precision with the aid of roles is accompanied by a 10 percent reduction of recall.. Links provide for approximately the same increase of precision.. The author states the general requirements to a simple and flexible grammar for descriptor languages, and show that the approach the suggest ts has been partially implemented in the information retrieval language for radioelectronics and computer technology developed at the Institute of Cybernetics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kiev, and in the SYNTOL (France).. .X 29	1	1175 68	1	1175 69	1	1175 119	1	1175 151	1	1175 175	1	1175 261	1	1175 346	1	1175 382	1	1175 388	1	1175 458	2	1175 476	1	1175 477	1	1175 478	1	1175 479	1	1175 480	1	1175 484	1	1175 485	1	1175 566	1	1175 680	1	1175 704	1	1175 761	1	1175 781	1	1175 798	1	1175 1118	2	1175 1163	1	1175 1175	5	1175 1175	5	1175
