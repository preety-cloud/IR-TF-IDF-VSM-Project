Compact Book Storage in Libraries .A Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F. .A Cox, J. Grady A method is developed for optimally shelving inventory items by size, with particular reference to large library collections..  The area presented by n+1 distinct shelf heights is minimized for any collection that can be characterized by an item-height distribution.. When item-height is continuous, the necessary conditions for the extremum are recursive in the optimal shelf heights, and the solution reduces to a simple computational search.. For certain distribution functions, as demonstrated in the example, an additional recursive relation between the solutions for different n further simplified the computation considerable.. Geometrical representations of both the model and the solution method are presented.. The maximum increase in storage capacity can be expressed generally as a simple function of the mean and the maximum item-height.. .X 62	1	1184 67	1	1184 245	1	1184 267	1	1184 278	1	1184 435	1	1184 515	1	1184 654	1	1184 925	1	1184 1184	5	1184 1187	1	1184 1317	1	1184 1417	1	1184 1417	1	1184
