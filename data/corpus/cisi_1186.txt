Organization and Environment Managing Differentiation and Integration .A Lawrence, Paul R. .A Lorsch,Jay W. What organizational characteristics are required to deal effectively with different external market and technological conditions?  This is the central question which this book addresses.. Such a question is quite different from the central theme of most earlier organizational studies, which have tended to focus on the question of what is the one best way to organize, irrespective of the external environmental conditions facing the business.. In this important respect this study breaks new ground.. Nevertheless, it draws heavily on earlier studies in the field of organization behavior at Harvard Business School and elsewhere, as well as the related literature of the behavioral sciences.. The authors not only report the findings of a comparative study of ten organizations with different levels of economic performance in three distinct industrial environments, but also use these findings to unravel some of the apparent contradictions in current organization theory.. A discussion of the implications of these findings for the design and administration of large organizations in relation to their specific market and technological environments is also included.. .X 15	2	1186 105	1	1186 139	1	1186 173	1	1186 227	1	1186 272	1	1186 298	1	1186 356	1	1186 418	1	1186 560	1	1186 1048	1	1186 1070	1	1186 1150	2	1186 1186	9	1186 1187	2	1186 1188	1	1186 1240	1	1186 1320	1	1186 1321	1	1186 1333	2	1186 1362	1	1186 1384	1	1186 1408	1	1186 1408	1	1186
