Organizations .A March, J.G. This book is about the theory of formal organizations.  It is easier, and probably more useful, to give examples of formal organizations than to define the term.  The United States Steel Corporation is a formal organization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New York State Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part of a larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposes we need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn around an organization or the exact distinction between an "organization" and a "nonorganization."  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the world has an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean classifications. Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged. We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However much organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and administrators, and however many books for these practitioners have been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant place in modern social science.  Most current psychology and sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the subject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology (Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, "industrial social psychology" (with only passing references to organizations), leadership, and voting behavior.  There is no comparable chapter on formal organizations, and only scattered reference to them throughout the text. .X 15	1	1187 39	1	1187 61	1	1187 62	2	1187 67	3	1187 83	1	1187 100	1	1187 120	1	1187 139	1	1187 173	1	1187 227	1	1187 292	1	1187 312	1	1187 343	1	1187 356	2	1187 418	1	1187 435	1	1187 436	1	1187 437	1	1187 584	1	1187 965	1	1187 1036	1	1187 1037	1	1187 1041	1	1187 1070	1	1187 1150	1	1187 1154	1	1187 1184	1	1187 1186	2	1187 1187	8	1187 1333	2	1187 1406	1	1187 1408	1	1187 1416	1	1187 1417	1	1187 1417	1	1187
