Organizations in Action Social Science Bases of Administrative Theory .A Thompson, J.D. This book might be considered a conceptual inventory.  This is a departure from the recent fashion of conducting "propositional inventories," which assumes that important relationships have already been explored (Berelson and Steiner, 1964).  I assume merely that the concepts relevant to important relationships exist, and once having identified some, I hope to generate potentially significant propositions.  We lack the systematic evidence that eventually must come, but there are illustrative studies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time- nor space-bound. I assume that there are differences among organizations, and hope to account for some of them.  But I also assume that there is not a one- to-one correspondence between significant organizational differences and the typical categories of business, government, medicine, and education. Likewise, I believe there is not a direct correlation between the academic disciplines and useful categories of complex organizations. .X 15	1	1188 105	1	1188 214	1	1188 218	1	1188 227	1	1188 250	1	1188 340	1	1188 348	1	1188 375	1	1188 560	1	1188 855	1	1188 986	1	1188 1012	1	1188 1036	1	1188 1041	1	1188 1048	1	1188 1154	1	1188 1186	1	1188 1188	5	1188 1379	1	1188 1408	1	1188 1408	1	1188
