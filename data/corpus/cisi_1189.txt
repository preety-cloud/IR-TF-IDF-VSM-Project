Organizing Nonprint Material .A Daily, T.E. The object of this book is to establish a means for organizing collections of nonprint material so that greatest efficiency can match most effective service.  No lesser goal is worthy of consideration. In discussing the problems of organization, the examples of material have been used to explain differences in treatment that can be made responsive to the needs of the community that the library serves. Nonprint material is a vital part of a modern library of whatever type.  School libraries have made the greatest use of the material so far, to the point of becoming media-centers, but the avalanche of information is not only in print form and the need for information may often be satisfied only by nonprint material. .X 141	1	1189 231	1	1189 299	1	1189 333	1	1189 352	1	1189 522	1	1189 530	1	1189 627	1	1189 628	1	1189 873	1	1189 874	1	1189 875	1	1189 876	1	1189 892	1	1189 941	1	1189 992	1	1189 994	1	1189 995	1	1189 996	1	1189 997	1	1189 998	1	1189 1079	1	1189 1153	2	1189 1189	7	1189 1251	1	1189 1351	1	1189 1396	1	1189 1420	1	1189 1434	1	1189 1435	1	1189 1442	1	1189 1442	1	1189
