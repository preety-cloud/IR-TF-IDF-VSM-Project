Compaction of Names by X-grams .A Walker, Verdon R. This paper presents a method for compacting proper given names for computer storage.. The method presented uses x-grams which are combinations of from one to eight letters.. Rather than spelling names letter by letter, they are "spelled" with x-grams.. An algorithm as been implemented in a computer program and used to obtain sets of x-grams for two large (42,165 and 43,875) given name samples.. Using the x-grams obtained, it was possible to represent the names from one sample in 1.78 bits per original character and in 2.1 bits per original character in the second sample.. .X 19	1	1194 228	3	1194 318	1	1194 321	2	1194 324	1	1194 329	2	1194 416	3	1194 442	3	1194 450	2	1194 495	2	1194 511	3	1194 524	3	1194 563	1	1194 565	1	1194 567	1	1194 835	2	1194 851	2	1194 862	2	1194 867	1	1194 875	1	1194 1194	5	1194 1196	1	1194 1199	2	1194 1396	1	1194 1398	1	1194 1398	1	1194
