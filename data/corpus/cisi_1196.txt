Retrieval of Bibliographic Entries from a Name-Title Catalog by Use of Truncated Search Keys .A Kilgour, Frederick G. Long, Philip L. Leiderman, Eugene B. An experiment to produce information on the utility of co-ordinating derived, truncated search keys as enquiry terms to an on-line bibliographic system was performed on a file of 132,808 name-title entries.. Statistics on the number of entries associated with each key for keys varying from four to eight characters in length were obtained.. Assuming use of a keyboard cathode ray tube terminal capable of displaying at least ten lines of text, and taking spelling error probabilities into account, a derived key consisting of the first three characters of author name concatenate with the first three characters of title was determined to be effective for at least four-fifths of all academic libraries.. .X 90	2	1196 316	1	1196 318	1	1196 329	1	1196 348	1	1196 359	1	1196 416	1	1196 511	1	1196 620	1	1196 700	1	1196 791	1	1196 835	1	1196 836	3	1196 851	3	1196 856	1	1196 862	1	1196 867	1	1196 868	9	1196 869	7	1196 871	3	1196 872	4	1196 875	1	1196 876	2	1196 897	1	1196 1193	1	1196 1194	1	1196 1196	16	1196 1197	4	1196 1197	4	1196
