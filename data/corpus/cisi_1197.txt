Retrieval of Single Entries from a Computerized Library Catalog File .A Kilgour, F.G. The major intellectual challenges confronting an architect of a total computerized library system is organization of a efficient file of millions of bibliographic references from which a single entry can be retrieved swiftly and uniquely.  Research on file organization has concentrated on retrieval of multiple entries possessing some equal or similar characteristic.  However, a basic library bibliographic file should be organized to yield a record unequal and dissimilar to all others.  Such a file is analogous to the familiar main entry catalog, which every library maintains, and would have associated with it supplementary index files of subjects, titles, call numbers, and perhaps other attributes. .X 90	1	1197 281	1	1197 348	1	1197 601	1	1197 835	3	1197 836	2	1197 851	6	1197 862	2	1197 863	1	1197 868	4	1197 869	2	1197 871	1	1197 872	1	1197 981	1	1197 984	1	1197 1013	1	1197 1196	4	1197 1197	9	1197 1197	9	1197
