Design and Evaluation of Information Systems .A Katter, R.V. In corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening of content coverage.  The initial emphasis was on design and evaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely - and narrowly - connected with information storage and retrieval systems.  It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that there are many activities and ideas outside of this context that have, or can have, a very important bearing on the work of systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working on library and documentation systems.  This chapter attempts to continue enlarging our perception of the range of reported activities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in which our readers are chiefly interested. .X 39	1	120 67	1	120 83	1	120 120	6	120 128	1	120 135	2	120 139	1	120 172	1	120 197	1	120 244	1	120 245	1	120 291	1	120 292	1	120 382	1	120 459	1	120 506	1	120 575	1	120 584	1	120 599	1	120 621	1	120 630	1	120 634	1	120 692	1	120 696	1	120 705	1	120 736	1	120 795	1	120 826	1	120 907	1	120 925	1	120 1038	1	120 1101	1	120 1178	1	120 1187	1	120 1402	1	120 1426	1	120 1426	1	120
