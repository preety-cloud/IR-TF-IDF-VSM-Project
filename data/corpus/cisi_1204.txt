Perceptions An Introduction to Computational Geometry .A Minsky, M. The goal of this study is to reach a deeper understanding of some concepts we believe are crucial to the general theory of computation. We will study in great detail a class of computations that make decisions by weighing evidence.  Certainly, this problem is of great interest in itself, but our real hope is that understanding of its mathematical structure will prepare us eventually to go further into the almost unexplored theory of parallel computers. .X 397	3	1204 417	3	1204 430	3	1204 443	3	1204 455	3	1204 464	3	1204 745	3	1204 1045	1	1204 1204	5	1204 1398	3	1204 1427	3	1204 1427	3	1204
