Keeping up with What's Going on in Physics AIP's Current Physics Information program offers new products to help scientists and engineers stay up-to-date .A Herschman, A. In 1966, AIP had a modest program in physics information supported by the National Science Foundation.  The program went back several years, and AIP was considering a major expansion. The first task faced in such an expansion was to augment the staff so as to be interdisciplinary in physics, computer operations and scientific information.  The staff would be able to analyze and extend the studies made at AIP and elsewhere, and would formulate a basic approach. .X 91	1	1208 253	1	1208 429	1	1208 513	1	1208 580	1	1208 582	1	1208 588	1	1208 589	1	1208 603	1	1208 613	1	1208 614	1	1208 618	1	1208 657	1	1208 685	3	1208 686	2	1208 691	2	1208 721	2	1208 722	1	1208 724	1	1208 725	2	1208 765	1	1208 770	1	1208 776	1	1208 958	1	1208 987	1	1208 988	1	1208 1208	5	1208 1209	1	1208 1290	1	1208 1293	1	1208 1299	2	1208 1302	1	1208 1302	1	1208
