Document Dissemination .A Landau, H.B. This chapter is directed to those whose vocation (or avocation) is information.  While we may call ourselves librarians, information scientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists, IS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have one thing in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in the dissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interested in far more than the techniques for transmission of information from one point to another.  Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that "the medium is the message," we must concern ourselves with not only the means of document dissemination, but also the content and value of the documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout most of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should think of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data, evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling their transmission to a target: the reader. .X 13	1	121 18	1	121 76	1	121 121	5	121 125	1	121 127	1	121 129	1	121 145	1	121 201	1	121 213	1	121 465	1	121 466	1	121 541	1	121 720	1	121 873	1	121 881	1	121 914	1	121 919	1	121 920	1	121 921	1	121 1143	1	121 1362	1	121 1363	2	121 1441	1	121 1441	1	121
