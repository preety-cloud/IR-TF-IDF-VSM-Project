Is There a Pecking Order in Physics Journals? Analysis of close to a million citations puts Physical Review at the top of the list, but the order changes when we adjust for "impact" and "immediacy." .A Inhaber, H. When physicists wish to communicate their work by means of publication, several considerations are weighed before choosing the appropriate journal. There is the matter of audience; of the probable delay between acceptance and publication; of article format (letter, review, standard research report). If the article is potentially controversial, the author may estimate its chances of being accepted by different journals. Considerations of national pride may sway the choice:  An author may submit a work to a journal in his own country rather than to one that has a greater circulation and impact but is published in a foreign country. .X 37	1	1210 47	1	1210 48	2	1210 102	1	1210 113	1	1210 167	1	1210 198	1	1210 378	1	1210 503	1	1210 513	1	1210 543	1	1210 614	2	1210 618	1	1210 635	2	1210 638	2	1210 735	1	1210 748	1	1210 753	1	1210 756	1	1210 757	1	1210 787	1	1210 792	1	1210 821	1	1210 831	1	1210 952	2	1210 953	1	1210 1083	1	1210 1210	5	1210 1254	1	1210 1256	1	1210 1260	2	1210 1275	2	1210 1276	1	1210 1278	1	1210 1300	1	1210 1302	4	1210 1308	1	1210 1313	1	1210 1369	1	1210 1373	1	1210 1418	1	1210 1418	1	1210
