The Planning of Academic and Research Library Buildings .A Metcalf, K.D. This volume deals with the planning of academic and research library buildings.  Library buildings house library collections of various kinds, chiefly books and other printed matter; seating accommodations and other facilities for library users; quarters for the library staff that acquires, catalogues, and serves the collections; and, in addition, architectural or what is preferably known as non-assignable space. (If there if space left over after caring for the above needs, it is sometimes assigned for other purposes.) .X 7	3	1211 240	1	1211 262	2	1211 353	2	1211 365	1	1211 367	1	1211 969	1	1211 971	1	1211 1028	1	1211 1068	1	1211 1203	1	1211 1211	10	1211 1212	3	1211 1266	2	1211 1424	1	1211 1425	1	1211 1425	1	1211
