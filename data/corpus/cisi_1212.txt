Planning the College and University Library Building: A book for campus planners and architects .A Ellsworth, R.E. This book is intended to help campus planners, architects, and librarians in the early stages of the planning process. Three aspects of the problem deserve more careful treatment than they have received.  These are: the effects of automation and electronics on planning; the overall organization of service patterns; and, the relevance of other audiovisual learning media. This is a book about the planning process, not the details of all parts of a building.  It will not tell you which floor covering is best, which light fixtures to use or which kind of library shelving to buy.  These matters are treated in detail by Metcalf.  It will, however, try to tell you how to go about solving these and the many other problems planners face. Wherever it seems relevant and proper, I have included sketches to illustrate the point under discussion.  For the simplicity of these illustrations, I beg the indulgence of the reader. .X 7	1	1212 240	1	1212 262	2	1212 353	1	1212 365	1	1212 907	1	1212 1028	1	1212 1068	1	1212 1203	1	1212 1211	3	1212 1212	5	1212 1266	2	1212 1424	1	1212 1425	1	1212 1425	1	1212
