PRECIS:  a manual of concept analysis and subject indexing .A Austin, D. In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new technique of chain indexing to British libraries.  Twenty years later, with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first issues of 1971. To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example. In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified by the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical file.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal of Cutter's "Rules for a dictionary catalog" is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of natural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselected component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings would be co-extensive with the subject of the document. .X 86	1	1215 146	1	1215 160	1	1215 168	2	1215 194	1	1215 258	1	1215 259	1	1215 434	1	1215 445	1	1215 449	1	1215 458	1	1215 478	3	1215 480	4	1215 487	1	1215 530	1	1215 746	2	1215 758	1	1215 781	1	1215 817	2	1215 819	1	1215 824	1	1215 825	7	1215 874	1	1215 880	1	1215 901	1	1215 1024	5	1215 1027	1	1215 1054	1	1215 1061	1	1215 1146	1	1215 1215	19	1215 1230	2	1215 1231	1	1215 1255	1	1215 1265	1	1215 1441	1	1215 1443	1	1215 1448	1	1215 1448	1	1215
