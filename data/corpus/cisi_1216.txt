Prejudices and Antipathies: A tract on the LC subject heads concerning people .A Berman, S. Since the first edition of Library of Congress subject headings appeared 60 years ago, American and other libraries have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority -- if not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There can be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a labor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its value as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic. Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to ordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as Washington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarship are, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally, manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the worldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realm of headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with humanity--the LC list can only "satisfy" parochial, jingoistic Europeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally Christian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably situated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely domiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established Order, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of Western civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed, obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to young people and women.  And exudes something less than sympathy or even fairness toward organized labor and the sexually unorthodox or "avant-garde." .X 79	1	1216 92	2	1216 235	1	1216 246	2	1216 247	1	1216 326	1	1216 333	2	1216 361	1	1216 382	1	1216 449	1	1216 530	1	1216 553	1	1216 608	1	1216 628	1	1216 802	1	1216 819	1	1216 825	2	1216 874	3	1216 877	1	1216 878	1	1216 881	1	1216 883	1	1216 930	1	1216 940	1	1216 941	2	1216 950	2	1216 966	1	1216 978	1	1216 988	1	1216 991	1	1216 992	1	1216 993	1	1216 995	1	1216 997	3	1216 1000	1	1216 1079	2	1216 1153	1	1216 1216	13	1216 1266	2	1216 1395	2	1216 1421	2	1216 1434	1	1216 1435	1	1216 1436	1	1216 1441	1	1216 1441	1	1216
