Principles of Operations Research with Applications to Managerial Decisions .A Wagner, H.M. This book is written primarily for college students who have no previous background in operations research and who intend careers as administrators, consultants, executives, or managers in business, nonprofit enterprises, or government.  The broad topic coverage also should make the text helpful for students who seek careers as teachers and researchers as well as for practitioners who desire an up-to-date review of operations research.  The book can be used in half-year or full-year introductory courses for juniors, seniors, or graduates in business, economics, and engineering curricula. The central goal of the book is to answer the question, "What are the fundamental ideas of operations research?"  The text does not presuppose any advanced training in business administration, industrial engineering, mathematics, statistics, probability theory, or economics.  Therefore, the main ideas do not rely on the reader's being expert in these areas.  The text does assume, however, that the reader is not entirely naive about such subjects. .X 3	1	1219 5	1	1219 62	1	1219 90	1	1219 91	1	1219 158	1	1219 172	2	1219 175	1	1219 222	2	1219 223	1	1219 267	1	1219 360	2	1219 368	1	1219 435	1	1219 471	2	1219 494	1	1219 515	1	1219 587	1	1219 615	1	1219 660	1	1219 792	1	1219 810	1	1219 815	1	1219 823	1	1219 840	1	1219 907	2	1219 915	1	1219 925	2	1219 948	1	1219 957	1	1219 960	1	1219 1023	1	1219 1082	1	1219 1219	10	1219 1227	1	1219 1268	2	1219 1324	1	1219 1365	1	1219 1386	1	1219 1390	1	1219 1402	1	1219 1416	1	1219 1417	3	1219 1418	2	1219 1426	2	1219 1426	2	1219
