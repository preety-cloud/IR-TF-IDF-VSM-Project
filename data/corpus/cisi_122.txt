Information Networks .A Overhage, C.F.J. The rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and used in our complex society has presented us with major problems in information transfer.  We encounter these problems not only in libraries, information centers, and schools, but also in many of the operations of government and business.  The handling of large amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management of our way of life.  We are a technologically oriented society, and we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help us perform our enormous information transfer task.  Beginning with the telegraph and continuing through the telephone, through radio and television to the communications satellite, the methods of electrical signal transmission have served to distribute information to its ultimate users. .X 24	1	122 74	1	122 75	1	122 119	5	122 122	6	122 336	1	122 365	1	122 394	1	122 452	1	122 453	1	122 526	1	122 528	1	122 612	1	122 684	1	122 855	2	122 872	1	122 903	1	122 907	1	122 908	1	122 940	1	122 955	2	122 1011	3	122 1143	1	122 1247	1	122 1264	1	122 1367	1	122 1435	1	122 1436	1	122 1451	1	122 1451	1	122
