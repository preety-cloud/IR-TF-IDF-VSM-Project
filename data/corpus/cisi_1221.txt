Problems in Organizing Library Collections .A Hickey, D.J. In the area of library work often called "cataloging" and, more broadly, "technical services," the student may fall into two errors: that of assuming that all work is strictly routine and mechanical, and that of viewing the tasks of organizing a library collection as self-contained.  One purpose of the case studies here presented is to help correct both these errors, and to do so by illuminating some of the ways in which interpersonal relations affect the character of the routines and by setting the organizational tasks in the broader context of the total library situation. .X 90	2	1221 231	1	1221 261	1	1221 289	1	1221 294	1	1221 295	1	1221 299	1	1221 334	1	1221 354	1	1221 366	1	1221 553	1	1221 608	1	1221 610	1	1221 612	1	1221 617	2	1221 620	2	1221 815	1	1221 938	1	1221 939	1	1221 963	1	1221 990	1	1221 991	1	1221 992	1	1221 1057	1	1221 1221	6	1221 1229	1	1221 1269	1	1221 1318	1	1221 1365	1	1221 1390	1	1221 1390	1	1221
