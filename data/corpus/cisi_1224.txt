On one model of semantic information theory .A Shreider, Y.A. Text processing problems (such as automatic translation and automatic abstracting) create a need for defining explicit concepts, which should be characterized as the properties and quantity of semantic information contained in document texts. In fact, we need a formal model, which lets us describe the process of semantic text analysis. Semantic text analysis could be described from the point of view of someone with a different "conception of the world" - e.g. the text of very meaningful article does not contain, in fact, any information for people who are not specialists in the given mathematic field. Therefore, the formal model must contain descriptions of the "conception of the world: of the given observer. Such a description we call a thesaurus. Semantic text analysis we interpret as changing the thesaurus in response to a given text. .X 25	1	1224 228	1	1224 229	1	1224 540	1	1224 1133	1	1224 1138	1	1224 1159	1	1224 1162	1	1224 1169	1	1224 1224	7	1224 1224	7	1224
