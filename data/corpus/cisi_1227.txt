Production and Distribution .A Machlup, F. Anything that goes under the name of "production and distribution" sounds as if it clearly fell into the economist's domain.  An analysis of "knowledge," on the other hand, seems to be the philosopher's task, though some aspects of it are claimed by the sociologist.  But if one speaks of the "communication of knowledge in the United States," the specialist in education may feel that this is in his bailiwick; also the mathematician or operations researcher specializing in communication theory and information systems may prick up his ears.  In fact, some of the knowledge to be discussed here is technological, and thus the engineer may properly be interested.  When I tried out the title of this study on representatives of various disciplines, many were rather surprised that an economist would find himself qualified to undertake this kind of research. .X 5	1	1227 10	1	1227 22	1	1227 74	1	1227 83	1	1227 90	1	1227 91	1	1227 127	1	1227 144	1	1227 145	1	1227 158	1	1227 169	1	1227 222	1	1227 223	1	1227 239	1	1227 245	1	1227 273	1	1227 279	1	1227 288	1	1227 331	1	1227 358	1	1227 368	1	1227 369	1	1227 376	1	1227 381	1	1227 400	1	1227 408	1	1227 435	1	1227 471	1	1227 490	1	1227 496	1	1227 591	1	1227 592	1	1227 615	1	1227 723	1	1227 724	1	1227 781	1	1227 815	1	1227 834	1	1227 860	1	1227 910	1	1227 925	2	1227 935	1	1227 946	1	1227 957	3	1227 976	1	1227 1005	1	1227 1006	1	1227 1018	1	1227 1023	1	1227 1032	1	1227 1049	1	1227 1056	1	1227 1081	1	1227 1082	1	1227 1145	3	1227 1148	3	1227 1201	1	1227 1219	1	1227 1227	18	1227 1232	1	1227 1240	1	1227 1270	1	1227 1302	1	1227 1306	1	1227 1317	1	1227 1353	1	1227 1359	1	1227 1360	1	1227 1365	1	1227 1384	1	1227 1389	1	1227 1390	2	1227 1396	1	1227 1400	1	1227 1406	1	1227 1410	1	1227 1424	1	1227 1444	1	1227 1444	1	1227
