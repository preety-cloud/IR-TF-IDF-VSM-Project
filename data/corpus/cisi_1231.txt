Prolegomena to Library Classification .A Ranganathan, S.R. Even while Edition 2 was under preparation, seeds had been sown to take the study of the Theory of Classification to a deeper level with the co-operation of a wider circle of workers.  An International Conference of Libraries and Documentation Centres was held in Brussels from 11 to 18 September 1955.  During the Conference, a whole forenoon was devoted to a Group Meeting on "Classification, General and Special", under my Chairmanship.  The following two resolutions recommended by the Group Meeting were adopted by the Plenary Meeting on 16 September 1955. "1 The FID recommends that a deeper and more extensive study should be made of the general theory of classification, including facet analysis, and also of their application in the documentation of specific subjects. "2 The Commission proposes, that in liaison with the FID/CA Committee, a permanent Working Group be created in order to make mutual exchange of theoreticians' experiences and points of view possible.  The rapporteurs shall bring about the creation of such a group and furnish the information and means of work in order that practical results may be obtained in the shortest time, by making mail exchanges easier and more frequent.  The scheme proposed by Dr. Ranganathan will serve as the basic document" [154].  Further, at its meeting held on 16 September 1955, the Council of FID requested its Bureau to convene an International Seminar on Classification. This was in accord with the memorandum prepared by me at the request of Donker Duyvis [133]. .X 29	1	1231 58	1	1231 117	1	1231 154	1	1231 165	4	1231 168	1	1231 257	1	1231 258	1	1231 259	1	1231 260	1	1231 263	2	1231 337	1	1231 353	1	1231 388	1	1231 434	1	1231 445	2	1231 451	1	1231 471	1	1231 476	3	1231 477	2	1231 516	1	1231 525	2	1231 530	1	1231 542	1	1231 590	2	1231 609	1	1231 621	3	1231 641	2	1231 656	1	1231 668	1	1231 670	1	1231 671	1	1231 674	1	1231 683	1	1231 689	2	1231 715	1	1231 758	1	1231 762	1	1231 797	1	1231 814	1	1231 819	2	1231 898	1	1231 901	1	1231 911	1	1231 1024	1	1231 1027	1	1231 1053	1	1231 1066	3	1231 1073	1	1231 1077	3	1231 1215	1	1231 1231	18	1231 1255	1	1231 1259	2	1231 1391	2	1231 1393	1	1231 1394	1	1231 1413	1	1231 1414	1	1231 1429	1	1231 1430	1	1231 1443	1	1231 1448	1	1231 1448	1	1231
