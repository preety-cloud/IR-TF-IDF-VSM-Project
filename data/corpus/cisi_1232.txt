The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information .A Miller, G.A. My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer.  For seven years this number has followed me around, has intruded in my most private data, and has assaulted me from the pages of our most public journals.  This number assumes a variety of disguises, being sometimes a little larger and sometimes a little smaller than usual, but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable. The persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than a random accident.  There is, to quote a famous senator, a design behind it, some pattern governing its appearances. Either there really is something unusual about the number or else I am suffering from delusions of persecution. .X 26	1	1232 35	1	1232 42	1	1232 43	1	1232 52	1	1232 70	1	1232 73	1	1232 81	1	1232 95	1	1232 228	1	1232 229	1	1232 311	1	1232 420	1	1232 484	1	1232 578	1	1232 582	1	1232 589	1	1232 594	1	1232 595	1	1232 655	1	1232 656	1	1232 657	1	1232 842	1	1232 1046	1	1232 1054	1	1232 1154	1	1232 1227	1	1232 1232	7	1232 1236	1	1232 1281	1	1232 1295	1	1232 1298	1	1232 1385	1	1232 1400	1	1232 1427	1	1232 1427	1	1232
