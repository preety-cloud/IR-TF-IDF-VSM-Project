A Theory of Human Motivation .A Maslow, A.H. The present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive theory of motivation which will satisfy these theoretical demands and at the same time conform to the known facts, clinical and observational as well as experimental.  It derives most directly, however, from clinical experience. This theory is, I think, in the functionalist tradition of James and Dewey, and is fused with the holism of Wertheimer, Goldstein, and Gestalt Psychology, and with the dynamicism of Freud and Adler.  This fusion of synthesis may arbitrarily be called a 'general-dynamic' theory. .X 285	1	1233 296	1	1233 298	1	1233 304	1	1233 418	1	1233 843	1	1233 844	1	1233 1015	1	1233 1020	1	1233 1041	1	1233 1048	2	1233 1069	2	1233 1070	1	1233 1150	1	1233 1233	9	1233 1455	2	1233 1455	2	1233
