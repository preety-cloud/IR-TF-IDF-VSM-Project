Multidimensional Scaling by Optimizing Goodness of Fit to a Nonmetric Hypothesis .A Kruskal, J. B. Multidimensional scaling is the problem of representing n objects geometrically by n points, so that the interpoint distances correspond in some sense to experimental dissimilarities between objects.. In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete.. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related.. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis.. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit.. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a companion paper.. .X 377	1	1234 632	3	1234 1234	9	1234 1273	1	1234 1274	3	1234 1277	1	1234 1285	1	1234 1300	1	1234 1308	1	1234 1313	4	1234 1328	1	1234 1340	1	1234 1342	1	1234 1346	1	1234 1444	1	1234 1444	1	1234
