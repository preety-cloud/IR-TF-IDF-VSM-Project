Public Libraries in Cooperative Systems; Administrative patterns for service .A Gregory, R.W. This book was written as an introduction to the administrative relationships between small and medium-sized public libraries and the cooperative library system.  In this book, the definition of a cooperative system is as follows:  A cooperative library system is the combining of the talents and the resources of a group of independent libraries, within a reasonable geographic radius, for the purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources for the benefit of the actual and potential users of all the member libraries.  The plan for the book originated with questions directed to a public library administrator and to a system director.  The most pertinent of the repeated questions was, "How does system membership change local library administration?"  The sharpest question was, "Will the system ultimately take over local rights and responsibilities?" .X 311	1	1236 340	1	1236 431	1	1236 842	1	1236 910	1	1236 939	1	1236 1232	1	1236 1236	6	1236 1238	1	1236 1400	1	1236 1400	1	1236
