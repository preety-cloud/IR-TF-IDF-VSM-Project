Public Libraries as Culture and Social Centers: the origin of the concept .A Davies, D.W. This book is an attempt to trace the origins of non- book activities in public libraries, by which is meant the arrangement of fiestas, festivals, and exhibitions; the conduct of classes, contests, lectures, and excursions; the staging of plays, the exhibition of movies, the demonstration of karate and judo, and all similar activities not primarily concerned with books now carried on by public libraries. Since ideas about libraries, as well as librarians, have passed back and forth across the Atlantic with great facility, in this attempt to discover origins it seems wise to follow, however sketchily, developments in both America and Britain, and to note with some care what was happening in scholarly libraries, in popular libraries for the middle classes, and in libraries intended for the working classes. .X 234	1	1237 304	1	1237 306	1	1237 338	1	1237 646	1	1237 647	1	1237 651	1	1237 942	1	1237 943	1	1237 944	1	1237 948	1	1237 1017	1	1237 1049	1	1237 1206	1	1237 1237	5	1237 1378	1	1237 1440	1	1237 1450	1	1237 1453	1	1237 1453	1	1237
