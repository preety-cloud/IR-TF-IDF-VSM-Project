Public Library and City .A Conant, R.W. This volume is an edited collection of some papers from the 1963 Symposium on Library Functions in the Changing Metropolis sponsored by the Joint Center for Urban Studies and the National Book Committee.  Not all the papers delivered at the Symposium are included, and papers by Banfield, Blasingame, and myself were written especially for this volume.  The authors are urban social scientists, economists, historians, sociologists, political scientists, planners, communication experts, library scholars, and library administrators. The papers are about libraries and cities, and their main purpose is to raise issues about the character of cities and the future of libraries whose milieu is the city. .X 147	1	1238 245	1	1238 456	1	1238 1032	1	1238 1056	1	1238 1236	1	1238 1238	7	1238 1238	7	1238
