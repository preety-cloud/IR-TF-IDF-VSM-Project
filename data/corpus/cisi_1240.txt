The Public Library in the United States .A Leigh, R.D. The study as a whole is designed to stimulate public librarians to re-examine realistically their most useful function and greatest potential contribution at a time when methods of communication are undergoing rapid change.  As the traditional custodian of the printed word, the librarian has long had a distinctive and widely accepted role.  The Public Library Inquiry, especially in the concluding chapter of the present volume, brings to the center of attention problems and suggestions for change challenging a fresh appraisal.  It should arouse the interest of the public served by the libraries as well as aid the librarians themselves to an appreciation of an important American institution that must be kept ever alert to the needs of a democratic society. .X 31	1	1240 36	1	1240 41	1	1240 46	1	1240 173	1	1240 181	1	1240 182	1	1240 183	1	1240 184	1	1240 193	1	1240 195	1	1240 198	1	1240 201	1	1240 237	1	1240 239	1	1240 269	1	1240 273	1	1240 298	1	1240 358	2	1240 395	1	1240 415	1	1240 760	1	1240 767	1	1240 774	1	1240 778	1	1240 891	1	1240 905	1	1240 946	1	1240 952	1	1240 953	1	1240 964	1	1240 968	1	1240 1005	1	1240 1009	1	1240 1018	2	1240 1019	1	1240 1032	1	1240 1056	1	1240 1145	1	1240 1186	1	1240 1227	1	1240 1240	10	1240 1333	1	1240 1359	1	1240 1384	1	1240 1397	1	1240 1417	1	1240 1417	1	1240
