Quantitative Methods .A Hoadley, I.B. This Institute was designed both to encourage the use of quantitative measurement and to teach the techniques necessary for such use.  It was hoped that an emphasis on statistical measurement would upgrade administrative and research skills and thus contribute to more efficient and effective library management. Studies of librarians' academic backgrounds have indicated a preponderance of humanities and social science majors in the field.  Too often librarians have had only a few courses in mathematics, and some actually have a psychological antipathy toward numbers.  This anti-mathematics syndrome has kept librarians from taking proper advantage of quantitative methods. .X 9	1	1242 158	1	1242 207	1	1242 222	1	1242 223	1	1242 249	1	1242 292	1	1242 296	1	1242 297	1	1242 298	1	1242 300	1	1242 301	1	1242 302	1	1242 358	1	1242 364	1	1242 515	1	1242 535	1	1242 616	1	1242 625	1	1242 629	1	1242 631	1	1242 634	1	1242 791	1	1242 811	1	1242 816	1	1242 818	1	1242 823	2	1242 841	1	1242 842	1	1242 843	1	1242 844	1	1242 846	1	1242 915	1	1242 925	1	1242 948	1	1242 961	1	1242 962	1	1242 964	1	1242 994	1	1242 1015	1	1242 1242	6	1242 1247	1	1242 1250	1	1242 1268	1	1242 1317	1	1242 1354	1	1242 1401	1	1242 1403	1	1242 1428	1	1242 1428	1	1242
