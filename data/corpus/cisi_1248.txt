Reader in Library Service and the Computer .A Kaplan, L. The selections are intended mainly for students in library schools, and for librarians in the field who have not yet made themselves conversant with the literature of computer-based operations.  This is not a book, to state the proposition in the negative, for those who wish to read on the theoretical aspects of computers. The selections are brought together in seven sections.  The first, the Challenge, includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age of the computer. The second section, Varieties of Response, does not by any means exhaust developments in American libraries.  It does, I believe, contain representative descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished. The third section, Theory of Management, contains an outstanding article by Richard DeGennaro of Harvard.  The particular contributions made in this article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this third section. News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of selection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer. The considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the first selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific services now being offered, or services in the planning stage. The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a subject that has elicited considerable discussion.  The two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative costs. The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of view.  The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings. The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has excited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject indexing could in time prove considerable. .X 177	1	1248 235	1	1248 289	1	1248 291	1	1248 374	1	1248 408	1	1248 458	1	1248 471	1	1248 548	1	1248 594	1	1248 597	1	1248 598	1	1248 601	1	1248 836	1	1248 863	1	1248 864	1	1248 865	1	1248 866	1	1248 868	1	1248 897	1	1248 916	1	1248 936	1	1248 1052	1	1248 1248	7	1248 1327	1	1248 1327	1	1248
