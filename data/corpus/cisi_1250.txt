Reader in Research Methods for Librarianship .A Bundy, M.L. The fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to genuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship to the goals of librarianship.  Viewed in this way, and perhaps as antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical matters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with the rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual inquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and the scholar. Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which clearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically not only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys which derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit for the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative capacity, who have not before held this perspective of research. .X 616	1	1250 789	1	1250 795	1	1250 1242	1	1250 1250	7	1250 1403	1	1250 1422	1	1250 1428	1	1250 1428	1	1250
