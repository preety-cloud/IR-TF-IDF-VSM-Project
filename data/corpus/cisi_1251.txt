Reader in Technical Services .A Applebaum, E. L. This collection attempts to bring together a readable and germane group of materials ranging from history, review papers, and practical exposition to reports on current research and development and conjecture about the future.. It is expected that these selections will be of interest and use to the teacher and student.. It is also hoped that they will be of equal interest to the professional librarian and researcher.. There has been a deliberate attempt to exclude materials that have appeared in recently published collections.. It is for this reason that the names of Panizzi, Cutter, Martel, Hanson, Dewey, Rider, Bliss, Haykin, Shera, Lubetzky and others do not appear.. A specific focus has been given to this book.. It is in the direction of a rational sharing of local, national, and international efforts and the eventual coordination and standardization of practices in the technical services insofar as this is practical.. .X 141	1	1251 299	1	1251 333	1	1251 522	1	1251 530	1	1251 627	1	1251 628	1	1251 873	1	1251 874	1	1251 875	1	1251 876	1	1251 892	1	1251 941	1	1251 994	1	1251 995	1	1251 996	1	1251 997	1	1251 998	1	1251 1079	1	1251 1153	1	1251 1189	1	1251 1251	6	1251 1322	1	1251 1351	1	1251 1396	1	1251 1420	1	1251 1434	1	1251 1435	1	1251 1442	1	1251 1442	1	1251
