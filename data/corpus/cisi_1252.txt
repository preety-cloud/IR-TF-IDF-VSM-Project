The Recording of Library of Congress Bibliographical Data in Machine Form .A Buckland, L. F. This report describes the results of a study of a practical method of preparing Library of Congress card catalog data in machine form for (1) the automatic typesetting of cards and book catalogs, and (2) distribution to other libraries throughout the country for all foreseeable bibliographic and typographic applications of such data, including preparation of local catalogs.. The first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a perforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the card.. After the data is edited and corrected, it is processed by a computer to form (1) catalog card typesetting tapes, (2) the National Union Catalog, (3) Library of Congress Books, Subjects Catalog, magnetic tape catalog files, and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution.. The procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on Library of Congress cards, should studies find that the value of the data exceeds the cost of recording it.. A demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce perforated tape records.. These record tapes were automatically converted to a variety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and book catalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards.. .X 159	1	1252 178	2	1252 200	1	1252 249	1	1252 852	1	1252 854	1	1252 857	1	1252 858	1	1252 859	1	1252 861	1	1252 970	1	1252 978	1	1252 997	1	1252 1012	1	1252 1042	1	1252 1043	3	1252 1071	1	1252 1252	5	1252 1371	1	1252 1371	1	1252
