Report on the Testing and Analysis of an Investigation into the Comparative Efficiency of Indexing Systems .A Cleverdon, C.W. This volume continues the account of the Aslib-Cranfield project as given in the "Final Report of the First Stage of an Investigation into the Comparative Efficiency of Indexing Systems".  The major portion of the two years spent on this present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerable amount of data which was obtained from the main test programme.  A difficulty in this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely to yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonable limits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, and even so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has been placed on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this is considered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has not, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance, but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval of non-relevant references.  This analysis has not been attempted within the present work, but will be one of the matters to be investigated in the continuation of the project. .X 44	1	1255 50	1	1255 52	1	1255 57	2	1255 61	3	1255 73	2	1255 75	1	1255 131	1	1255 134	1	1255 146	1	1255 149	1	1255 154	1	1255 175	1	1255 176	1	1255 257	1	1255 259	1	1255 260	1	1255 329	1	1255 382	2	1255 389	2	1255 390	3	1255 434	1	1255 445	1	1255 449	1	1255 458	1	1255 474	1	1255 476	1	1255 486	1	1255 488	1	1255 565	2	1255 572	1	1255 595	1	1255 596	1	1255 608	1	1255 619	1	1255 752	2	1255 769	1	1255 773	1	1255 780	2	1255 781	1	1255 785	3	1255 795	1	1255 810	1	1255 812	1	1255 813	1	1255 814	1	1255 870	1	1255 874	1	1255 894	1	1255 907	1	1255 928	1	1255 963	1	1255 966	3	1255 990	1	1255 991	1	1255 1066	1	1255 1084	1	1255 1154	1	1255 1191	1	1255 1215	1	1255 1231	1	1255 1255	15	1255 1265	1	1255 1268	1	1255 1282	2	1255 1286	1	1255 1294	1	1255 1327	1	1255 1380	1	1255 1394	1	1255 1413	1	1255 1414	1	1255 1429	1	1255 1430	1	1255 1445	1	1255 1448	1	1255 1448	1	1255
