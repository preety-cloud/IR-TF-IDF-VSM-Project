The Growth of the Literature of Physics .A Anthony, L. J. East, H. Slater, M. J. An examination is made of the current problems of the communication and dissemination of literature in the field of physics.. The growth of the literature is considered quantitatively with respect to the form, subject and origin of published material.. This is related to the general growth in scientific activity as exemplified by increases in numbers of physicists and of expenditure on research.. The results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the needs or demands of users of the physics literature are considered, particularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of information transfer, and the reactions of users to new services intended to remedy the deficiencies.. Finally, a number of recently established services - some designed to meet hitherto unsatisfied needs - are described.. The role of the computer in the development of local, national and international documentation systems is examined.. .X 48	1	1256 88	1	1256 89	2	1256 105	1	1256 110	1	1256 155	1	1256 157	1	1256 167	1	1256 201	1	1256 203	1	1256 314	1	1256 356	1	1256 373	1	1256 384	1	1256 544	1	1256 560	2	1256 582	1	1256 589	1	1256 614	1	1256 635	1	1256 638	1	1256 656	1	1256 685	1	1256 722	1	1256 748	1	1256 753	1	1256 756	1	1256 757	1	1256 787	1	1256 792	1	1256 821	1	1256 831	1	1256 889	1	1256 952	1	1256 953	1	1256 977	1	1256 1030	1	1256 1050	1	1256 1062	1	1256 1083	1	1256 1203	1	1256 1210	1	1256 1254	1	1256 1256	5	1256 1260	1	1256 1275	1	1256 1278	1	1256 1284	1	1256 1285	1	1256 1290	1	1256 1291	1	1256 1293	1	1256 1294	1	1256 1295	1	1256 1296	1	1256 1297	1	1256 1302	2	1256 1319	1	1256 1346	1	1256 1352	1	1256 1369	1	1256 1373	1	1256 1386	1	1256 1397	1	1256 1418	1	1256 1418	1	1256
