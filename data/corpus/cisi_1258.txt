Resources and Bibliographic Support for a Nationwide Library Program Final Report to the National Commission for Libraries and Information Science .A Palmour, V.E.

For each library, even the largest, the hope of adequately supplying its identified user groups has been greatly constrained by simultaneous inflation of both cost and quantity of materials.
