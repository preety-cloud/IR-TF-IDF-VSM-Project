Categories and Relators:  A New Scheme .A Perreault, J.M. If the (major) premise is accepted, that fully effective machine-strategization of a retrieval system depends upon the use of a (hierarchically) structural (but highly flexible) notation as the equivalent for the verbal access provided by either unitermic or articulated conceptual indicators, a faceted classification logically emerges as the desideratum. The two aspects of a structural notation most determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform use of general categories (the latter, not merely for the sake of uniformity as such, but as the means to a heightened flexibility).  These desiderata could of course be present on the "idea plane" alone; but without their being present notationally they do not furnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the type of assistance it requires for optimal functioning. The second (minor) premise ought to be that the Universal Decimal Classification, being both hierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desired structurality.  But the melancholy fact is that this desideratum is not always satisfied, for instance when UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy when division by general category would be equally appropriate. .X 258	1	1259 259	1	1259 263	1	1259 388	1	1259 476	2	1259 477	4	1259 516	1	1259 542	1	1259 653	2	1259 758	1	1259 838	2	1259 898	1	1259 1066	1	1259 1231	2	1259 1259	6	1259 1391	4	1259 1414	1	1259 1429	2	1259 1430	2	1259 1430	2	1259
