Why Don't They Ask Questions? .A Swope, M.J. Katzer, J. Recently, a great deal of emphasis has been placed upon communications, interviewing, and advisory counseling in the field of library science.  Studies done in these areas have dealt mainly with communication barriers, verbal and nonverbal communication, question-negotiation and patterns of information seeking, interviewing techniques for librarians, customer relations, and reference performance as they relate to the user and his confrontation with a librarian in seeking an answer to his question.  However, it seems that few people have been concerned with the user who for one reason or another, does not ask a librarian for assistance. .X 274	2	1263 278	1	1263 300	1	1263 364	1	1263 370	1	1263 459	1	1263 470	1	1263 532	1	1263 625	1	1263 646	1	1263 768	2	1263 826	1	1263 927	1	1263 1008	1	1263 1017	1	1263 1263	7	1263 1353	1	1263 1357	3	1263 1405	1	1263 1405	1	1263
