Rules for a Dictionary Catalog .A Cutter, C.A. No code of cataloging could be adopted in all points by every one, because the libraries for study and the libraries for reading have different objects, and those which combine the two do so in different proportions.  Again, the preparation of a catalog must vary as it is to be manuscript or printed, and, if the latter, as it is to be merely an index to the library, giving in the shortest possible compass clues by which the public can find books, or is to attempt to furnish more information on various points, or finally is to be made with a certain regard to what may be called style.  Without pretending to exactness, we may divide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-title or bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the Boston Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the Boston Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, the catalog now making by the Library of Congress.  To avoid the constant repetition of such phrases as "the full catalog of a large library" and "a concise finding-list," I shall use the three words Short, Medium, and Full as proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short family are not all the same size, that there is more than one Medium, and that Full may be Fuller and Fullest.  Short, if single-columned, is generally a title-a-liner; if printed in double columns, it allows the title occasionally to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium does not limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds four lines, and gets many titles into a single line.  Full usually fills three or four lines and often takes six or seven for a title. .X 63	1	1265 149	1	1265 175	1	1265 246	1	1265 247	2	1265 257	1	1265 259	1	1265 324	1	1265 348	1	1265 389	1	1265 390	1	1265 434	1	1265 445	1	1265 449	1	1265 487	1	1265 502	1	1265 579	1	1265 596	1	1265 600	1	1265 601	1	1265 653	1	1265 715	1	1265 797	1	1265 798	1	1265 799	1	1265 805	1	1265 807	1	1265 863	1	1265 864	1	1265 874	1	1265 956	1	1265 963	1	1265 987	1	1265 988	1	1265 989	1	1265 991	1	1265 1004	1	1265 1152	1	1265 1215	1	1265 1230	1	1265 1255	1	1265 1265	7	1265 1294	1	1265 1327	1	1265 1393	1	1265 1394	2	1265 1395	1	1265 1399	1	1265 1448	1	1265 1448	1	1265
