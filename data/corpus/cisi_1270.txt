Science Since Babylon .A Price, D.J.D. This book had its origin in a set of five public lectures given at the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University during October and November 1959 under the auspices of the Yale Department of History. The subject (whatever its name) had just come through a stage in its growing up during which it almost seemed as though every would-be practitioner of the art deemed it necessary to exhibit the completeness of his dedication by writing the history of the whole of science through all its periods.  Hoping that this historiographic phase had evaporated, and feeling incompetent in too many scientific and historical directions, I resolved instead to essay the experiment of speaking only from those areas in which I had reasonable firsthand experience at research. .X 48	1	1270 113	1	1270 144	1	1270 163	1	1270 350	1	1270 386	1	1270 398	1	1270 401	1	1270 560	1	1270 1038	1	1270 1081	1	1270 1082	1	1270 1087	1	1270 1201	1	1270 1227	1	1270 1270	5	1270 1273	1	1270 1287	1	1270 1301	1	1270 1304	1	1270 1306	1	1270 1337	1	1270 1338	1	1270 1344	1	1270 1444	1	1270 1444	1	1270
