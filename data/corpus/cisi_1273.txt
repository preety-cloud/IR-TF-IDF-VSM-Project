Bibliographical Statistics as a Guide to Growth Points in Science .A Meadows, A.J. O'connor, J.G. Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about trends in science.  For example, there has been a continuing interest in the question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its age.  These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the major branches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interested in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future. Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to push these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject division, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical properties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect of such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline. We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a statistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the appearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its first appearance can such an area be identified? .X 33	1	1273 39	1	1273 48	1	1273 89	1	1273 102	1	1273 106	1	1273 107	1	1273 111	1	1273 113	3	1273 155	1	1273 314	1	1273 605	1	1273 632	2	1273 784	1	1273 1087	1	1273 1234	1	1273 1270	1	1273 1273	7	1273 1274	3	1273 1285	2	1273 1287	1	1273 1300	1	1273 1301	1	1273 1302	1	1273 1304	2	1273 1312	1	1273 1313	3	1273 1337	2	1273 1338	2	1273 1341	1	1273 1342	1	1273 1344	1	1273 1346	1	1273 1347	1	1273 1387	1	1273 1444	3	1273 1444	3	1273
