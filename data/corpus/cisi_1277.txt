Citation Indexes for Science .A Garfield, E. In this paper I propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers.  It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of antecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they could be located quickly.  The citation index makes this check practicable. Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing the citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort required to compile it. This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a new approach to subject control of the literature of science.  By virtue of its different construction, it tends to bring together material that would never be collated by the usual subject indexing.  It is best described as an association-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway as he requires.  Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject heading. .X 19	1	1277 37	1	1277 39	2	1277 40	1	1277 41	1	1277 47	2	1277 50	1	1277 88	1	1277 97	1	1277 102	1	1277 103	1	1277 175	1	1277 233	1	1277 253	1	1277 313	1	1277 359	1	1277 377	3	1277 379	1	1277 395	1	1277 485	1	1277 486	1	1277 503	1	1277 505	1	1277 560	1	1277 573	1	1277 618	1	1277 632	2	1277 635	1	1277 667	1	1277 713	1	1277 748	1	1277 749	1	1277 751	1	1277 764	1	1277 765	1	1277 777	1	1277 778	1	1277 782	1	1277 804	1	1277 805	1	1277 893	1	1277 952	1	1277 1010	1	1277 1016	1	1277 1061	1	1277 1085	1	1277 1086	1	1277 1087	1	1277 1182	1	1277 1200	1	1277 1234	1	1277 1274	2	1277 1277	8	1277 1278	1	1277 1280	2	1277 1283	1	1277 1285	3	1277 1287	3	1277 1301	1	1277 1302	2	1277 1304	1	1277 1313	2	1277 1338	1	1277 1344	1	1277 1347	2	1277 1380	1	1277 1428	1	1277 1444	1	1277 1444	1	1277
