Design and Evaluation of Information Systems .A Swanson, R.W. The co-joining of "design" with "evaluation" that is called for by this chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the author.  In part, "design" and "evaluation" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components.  However, "design" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations.  "Evaluation" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of "design" and "evaluation" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. "Design" and "evaluation" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products. .X 120	1	128 128	6	128 129	1	128 130	2	128 135	1	128 167	1	128 191	1	128 223	1	128 225	1	128 234	1	128 244	1	128 245	1	128 280	1	128 291	1	128 330	1	128 339	1	128 370	1	128 376	1	128 387	1	128 393	1	128 453	1	128 459	1	128 468	1	128 494	1	128 560	1	128 575	1	128 599	1	128 621	1	128 623	1	128 629	1	128 630	1	128 639	1	128 646	3	128 647	2	128 648	1	128 651	1	128 652	2	128 692	1	128 729	1	128 744	1	128 748	1	128 757	1	128 765	1	128 818	1	128 822	1	128 823	2	128 827	2	128 831	1	128 888	1	128 893	1	128 919	1	128 925	2	128 943	1	128 944	1	128 1003	1	128 1070	1	128 1085	1	128 1291	1	128 1315	1	128 1340	1	128 1374	1	128 1375	1	128 1376	2	128 1390	1	128 1401	1	128 1402	1	128 1403	1	128 1437	1	128 1445	1	128 1457	1	128 1457	1	128
