Quantitative Growth of the Mathematical Literature .A May, K.O. Since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year (measured by counts of titles abstracted) has grown from about 800 to 13,000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2.5 percent per year, doubling about four times a century.  Deviations from the exponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If the total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from the curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles grows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations from an exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two "pauses" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel to the theoretical curve.  The well-known hypothesis of exponential growth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less than half that found by Price and other investigators.	The discrepancy appears to be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account the titles published before the beginnings of the time series used. .X 33	4	1286 36	1	1286 41	1	1286 48	2	1286 61	1	1286 89	1	1286 97	1	1286 101	1	1286 102	1	1286 104	1	1286 105	1	1286 106	1	1286 111	1	1286 112	1	1286 163	1	1286 183	1	1286 184	1	1286 193	1	1286 199	1	1286 203	1	1286 210	1	1286 225	1	1286 233	1	1286 269	1	1286 373	1	1286 544	1	1286 545	1	1286 552	1	1286 560	1	1286 587	1	1286 605	2	1286 613	1	1286 614	1	1286 631	1	1286 638	1	1286 667	1	1286 735	1	1286 747	1	1286 750	2	1286 753	1	1286 766	1	1286 767	1	1286 775	2	1286 782	1	1286 784	2	1286 788	1	1286 789	1	1286 793	1	1286 800	2	1286 808	1	1286 905	1	1286 907	1	1286 953	1	1286 977	1	1286 983	1	1286 1016	1	1286 1023	1	1286 1030	1	1286 1055	1	1286 1063	1	1286 1081	1	1286 1082	3	1286 1087	1	1286 1088	1	1286 1090	1	1286 1135	1	1286 1142	1	1286 1255	1	1286 1260	1	1286 1268	1	1286 1275	1	1286 1276	1	1286 1278	1	1286 1280	1	1286 1285	3	1286 1286	7	1286 1287	4	1286 1302	1	1286 1308	1	1286 1312	1	1286 1334	1	1286 1335	2	1286 1338	1	1286 1341	1	1286 1346	1	1286 1380	1	1286 1390	1	1286 1397	1	1286 1417	1	1286 1428	1	1286 1432	1	1286 1432	1	1286
