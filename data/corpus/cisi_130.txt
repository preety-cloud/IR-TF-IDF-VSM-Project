Cooperation in Information Activities Through International Organizations .A Adams, S. Werdel,J.A. International cooperation in the processing, sharing, and transfer of scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be accomplished through many agencies.  This chapter proposes to review the role played by international organizations in stimulating and providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation.  The international organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the second. .X 128	2	130 129	1	130 130	5	130 167	1	130 191	1	130 223	1	130 225	1	130 234	1	130 280	1	130 339	1	130 357	1	130 370	1	130 376	1	130 387	1	130 393	1	130 453	1	130 468	1	130 494	1	130 629	1	130 639	1	130 646	1	130 647	1	130 648	1	130 651	1	130 652	1	130 710	1	130 765	1	130 818	1	130 822	1	130 823	1	130 827	1	130 925	1	130 943	1	130 944	1	130 993	1	130 1070	1	130 1085	1	130 1374	1	130 1376	1	130 1390	1	130 1401	1	130 1403	1	130 1437	1	130 1457	1	130 1457	1	130
