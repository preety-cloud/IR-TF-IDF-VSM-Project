Science:  Growth and Change .A Menard, H.W. More and more examples accumulated of highly variable growth rates and of their influence on scientific careers.  Gradually the study began to incorporate calculations of the effects of variable growth on a wide range of scientific concerns: studying, teaching, research, publishing, citations, the basis of scientific prestige, promotions, unemployment.  It became apparent that generally unsuspected forces have a powerful influence on the careers of scientists and everyone else enmeshed in rapid change. This book presents some evidence for change and speculates about many effects.  It also makes a beginning toward understanding the forces that cause and do not cause change.  It may provide some solace for those in dormant fields who have wondered why life has passed them by.  It may, perhaps, make a few highly successful scientists a little more modest.  Most of all it may guide those who still have a choice - and so have we all. .X 33	2	1308 47	1	1308 48	1	1308 101	1	1308 102	1	1308 105	1	1308 113	1	1308 155	1	1308 503	1	1308 513	1	1308 544	1	1308 560	1	1308 587	1	1308 605	1	1308 638	1	1308 667	1	1308 750	1	1308 775	2	1308 793	1	1308 794	1	1308 800	2	1308 808	1	1308 1063	1	1308 1081	1	1308 1082	1	1308 1088	1	1308 1210	1	1308 1234	1	1308 1285	2	1308 1286	1	1308 1287	2	1308 1300	1	1308 1308	6	1308 1312	1	1308 1313	1	1308 1334	1	1308 1339	1	1308 1340	1	1308 1346	1	1308 1346	1	1308
