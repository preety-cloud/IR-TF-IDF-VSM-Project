Science and Information Theory .A Brillouin, L. A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory of information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or telegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively. From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations. Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics. .X 3	1	1309 60	1	1309 85	1	1309 149	1	1309 175	1	1309 258	1	1309 324	1	1309 346	1	1309 361	1	1309 388	1	1309 416	1	1309 457	1	1309 558	1	1309 585	1	1309 592	1	1309 593	1	1309 595	1	1309 665	1	1309 761	1	1309 803	2	1309 911	1	1309 1022	1	1309 1053	1	1309 1077	1	1309 1218	1	1309 1309	7	1309 1309	7	1309
