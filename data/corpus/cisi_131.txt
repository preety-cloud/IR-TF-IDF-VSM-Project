Introduction to the ADI Annual Review .A Cuadra, C.A. .B 1966 Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiry has begun to take shape.  This field, which will be referred to as "Information Science and Technology," draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with "information" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use. Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word "information" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services. The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume, is to provide such a review. .X 40	1	131 50	2	131 96	1	131 114	1	131 123	1	131 126	1	131 131	15	131 133	6	131 136	5	131 138	3	131 140	3	131 144	1	131 175	3	131 206	1	131 207	1	131 311	1	131 359	2	131 382	1	131 395	1	131 456	1	131 634	1	131 769	1	131 780	1	131 785	1	131 791	1	131 804	1	131 907	1	131 965	1	131 966	1	131 1019	1	131 1035	1	131 1037	1	131 1083	1	131 1255	1	131 1321	1	131 1327	1	131 1327	1	131
