The Scientific Community .A Hagstrom, W. This work is concerned with the influence of scientific colleagues on the conduct of one another's research.  With few exceptions, the discussion is limited to basic research in experimental sciences with well-established theories.  In this type of research, the scientific community is relatively autonomous, and the group of colleagues is the most important source of social influence on research.  Colleagues influence decisions to select problems and techniques, to publish results, and to accept theories. .X 105	1	1315 107	1	1315 110	1	1315 111	1	1315 112	1	1315 113	1	1315 128	1	1315 560	2	1315 646	1	1315 647	1	1315 652	1	1315 823	1	1315 827	1	1315 888	1	1315 919	1	1315 1003	1	1315 1063	1	1315 1291	1	1315 1300	1	1315 1302	1	1315 1315	5	1315 1339	1	1315 1340	1	1315 1342	1	1315 1345	1	1315 1347	1	1315 1387	1	1315 1445	1	1315 1445	1	1315
