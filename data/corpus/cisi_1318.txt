Scientific and Technical Libraries: Their Organization and Administration .A Strauss, L.J. The book is designed to serve multiple purposes.  First the needs of practicing librarians, particularly those who are just beginning their careers, and require a general guide and source of operational and bibliographic information, have been given special consideration.  A second purpose is to provide a textbook for library school and other advanced students whose interests are oriented toward the literature of the life and physical sciences.  The book could also help persons in management positions of organizations in which the establishment of a library is contemplated, presenting, if only from a review of the contents, the scope of such a department.  Finally it should be a good resource for library consultants engaged in assisting management to make the right decisions.  The requirements of all of these audiences have been assessed and endeavor made to meet their somewhat varied requirements. .X 90	1	1318 231	1	1318 261	1	1318 295	1	1318 299	1	1318 334	1	1318 354	1	1318 406	1	1318 608	1	1318 610	1	1318 617	1	1318 620	1	1318 815	1	1318 938	1	1318 939	1	1318 962	1	1318 991	1	1318 992	1	1318 1205	1	1318 1221	1	1318 1318	7	1318 1365	1	1318 1374	1	1318 1390	1	1318 1390	1	1318
