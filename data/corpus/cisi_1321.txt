Scientists in Organizations Productive Climates for Research and Development .A Pelz, D.C. This book is addressed to scientists and engineers, to administrators of research and development, and to all others who are concerned about the effects of organizations upon the work of their members.  This book is one of the first major studies to examine the relationship between a scientist's performance and the organization of his laboratory.  Unlike many previous expositions about the best environment for technical people, the findings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a wide range of research personnel. Work progressed over the next four years, and a number of intriguing results began to emerge.  But as these were discussed with other investigators studying different kinds of R & D laboratories, discrepancies appeared.  It became clear that a broader study was needed before one could be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for research personnel.  We set out to design a study in which standardized instruments would be administered to scientists and engineers in several types of laboratories. .X 4	1	1321 9	1	1321 15	1	1321 32	1	1321 96	3	1321 109	1	1321 131	1	1321 132	1	1321 137	2	1321 163	1	1321 207	1	1321 313	2	1321 356	1	1321 426	2	1321 456	1	1321 656	1	1321 658	1	1321 768	1	1321 771	1	1321 774	1	1321 783	1	1321 799	1	1321 811	1	1321 816	1	1321 913	1	1321 961	1	1321 962	1	1321 964	1	1321 968	1	1321 1068	1	1321 1150	2	1321 1154	1	1321 1186	1	1321 1203	1	1321 1320	1	1321 1321	18	1321 1407	3	1321 1408	2	1321 1445	1	1321 1454	1	1321 1454	1	1321
