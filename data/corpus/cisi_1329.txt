The Social Construction of Reality A Treatise on the Sociology of Knowledge .A Armor, D.J. The present volume is intended as a systematic, theoretical treatise in the sociology of knowledge.  It is not intended, therefore, to give a historical survey of the development of this discipline, or to engage in exegesis of various figures in this other other developments in sociological theory, or even to show how a synthesis may be achieved between several of these figures and developments.  Nor is there any polemic intent here.  Critical comments on other theoretical positions have been introduced (not in the text, but in the Notes) only where they may serve to clarify the present argument. .X 15	1	1329 21	1	1329 102	1	1329 105	2	1329 1030	1	1329 1063	1	1329 1235	1	1329 1271	1	1329 1272	1	1329 1311	1	1329 1329	5	1329 1386	3	1329 1387	1	1329 1389	1	1329 1389	1	1329
