Social Mobility in Industrial Society .A Lipset, S.M. In the present study, Professors Lipset and Bendix cast doubt on the validity of a number of widely accepted generalizations relating to social mobility: particularly (1) that there has been substantially less mobility in Europe than in the United States, (2) that social mobility tends to decline as industrial societies mature, and (3) that opportunities for entrance into the business elite become more restricted with mature industrialization.  In a careful analysis of the existing literature, the authors marshal an imposing array of evidence in support of their major thesis that social mobility is an integral and continuing aspect of the process of industrialization. .X 93	2	1331 308	1	1331 438	1	1331 1217	3	1331 1331	6	1331 1340	2	1331 1340	2	1331
