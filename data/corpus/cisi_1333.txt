The Social Psychology of Organizations .A Katz, D. In our attempts to extend the description and explanation of organizational processes we have shifted from an earlier emphasis on traditional concepts of individual psychology and interpersonal relations to system constructs.  The interdependent behavior of many people in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form or structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate collective level.  Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social structures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand, furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, our effort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization of an open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations. .X 15	1	1333 139	1	1333 274	1	1333 298	1	1333 312	1	1333 348	1	1333 356	2	1333 436	1	1333 437	1	1333 954	1	1333 957	1	1333 959	1	1333 962	1	1333 1005	1	1333 1018	1	1333 1036	1	1333 1041	1	1333 1065	1	1333 1067	1	1333 1149	1	1333 1150	1	1333 1154	1	1333 1186	2	1333 1187	2	1333 1205	1	1333 1240	1	1333 1333	11	1333 1348	1	1333 1353	1	1333 1384	1	1333 1406	1	1333 1406	1	1333
