Career Contingencies and the Fate of Sociological Research .A Oromaner, M. During the past three hundred years the journal article has become the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication. Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).  Who published what and where therefore becomes a central question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular scientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number of investigations concerning the career of such publications.  This career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages. 1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulates it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971). 2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journals for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). 3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the published article or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  The practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline. .X 33	2	1335 36	1	1335 41	1	1335 48	1	1335 88	2	1335 89	1	1335 97	1	1335 102	1	1335 103	1	1335 111	5	1335 112	2	1335 113	2	1335 163	1	1335 183	1	1335 184	1	1335 193	1	1335 199	1	1335 203	1	1335 210	1	1335 225	1	1335 233	1	1335 269	1	1335 373	1	1335 545	2	1335 552	1	1335 587	1	1335 605	1	1335 613	1	1335 614	1	1335 638	1	1335 735	1	1335 747	1	1335 750	1	1335 753	1	1335 764	1	1335 766	1	1335 767	1	1335 775	1	1335 782	1	1335 784	2	1335 788	1	1335 789	1	1335 793	2	1335 800	1	1335 808	1	1335 905	1	1335 953	1	1335 977	1	1335 983	1	1335 1016	1	1335 1023	1	1335 1030	1	1335 1055	1	1335 1062	1	1335 1082	1	1335 1087	1	1335 1090	1	1335 1135	1	1335 1260	1	1335 1275	1	1335 1276	1	1335 1278	1	1335 1280	1	1335 1285	1	1335 1286	2	1335 1287	2	1335 1302	2	1335 1335	7	1335 1338	1	1335 1341	1	1335 1390	1	1335 1397	1	1335 1417	1	1335 1428	1	1335 1432	1	1335 1432	1	1335
