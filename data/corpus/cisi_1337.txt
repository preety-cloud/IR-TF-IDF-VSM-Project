Social Stratification in Science .A Cole, J.R. In recent years social scientists have given increased attention to problems of inequality, justice, and discrimination in American society. The influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individuals is being studied in an effort to estimate the "fairness" of social institutions in rewarding talent.  Social scientists are trying to determine the extent to which so-called "irrelevant" characteristics influence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions and eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income, prestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society, science has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Little is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This book examines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratification of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance, or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment? A more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether universalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for recognition in the social system of science. .X 48	2	1337 55	1	1337 99	1	1337 100	1	1337 102	2	1337 106	1	1337 108	2	1337 113	2	1337 170	1	1337 314	1	1337 545	1	1337 592	1	1337 632	1	1337 747	1	1337 777	1	1337 791	1	1337 893	1	1337 1085	1	1337 1087	1	1337 1200	1	1337 1270	1	1337 1273	2	1337 1274	1	1337 1285	3	1337 1287	1	1337 1291	1	1337 1301	2	1337 1304	2	1337 1313	1	1337 1320	1	1337 1337	6	1337 1338	3	1337 1344	1	1337 1347	1	1337 1386	1	1337 1387	1	1337 1444	1	1337 1444	1	1337
