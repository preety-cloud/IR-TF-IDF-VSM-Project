The Social System of Science .A Storer, N.W. This book, is an exercise in sociological theory- building.  It attempts to develop a theory of the social organization of science.  I have tried to indicate its possible broader relevance by pointing out certain basic parallels between the "social system" of science and other social systems within society.  I hope, further, that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions I have drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seems now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who are concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goals of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior. My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most individuals, most of the time, come to "want" to do what it is that society "needs" them to do.  Only when we can answer this question satisfactorily, can we develop a sociology capable of providing both prediction and meaning. .X 32	1	1339 89	1	1339 96	1	1339 102	1	1339 103	1	1339 105	1	1339 109	1	1339 297	1	1339 298	1	1339 343	1	1339 391	1	1339 560	1	1339 951	1	1339 952	1	1339 1050	1	1339 1296	1	1339 1308	1	1339 1315	1	1339 1320	1	1339 1339	9	1339 1340	1	1339 1345	2	1339 1365	1	1339 1386	2	1339 1406	1	1339 1406	1	1339
