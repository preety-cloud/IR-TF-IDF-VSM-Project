Evaluation of Information Systems and Services .A Rees, A.M. This chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art in testing and evaluation.  Three tasks will be undertaken: to outline in some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and evaluation, to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to testing and evaluation, and finally, to provide some general conclusions with respect to past and future activity.  Although a distinction is made in this review between laboratory-based experimentation and tests of operational systems, the methodology used in each instance is substantially the same.  As yet, no full-scale and elaborate field approach has been attempted. .X 28	1	134 73	2	134 133	1	134 134	6	134 146	1	134 382	1	134 390	3	134 458	1	134 474	1	134 565	2	134 566	1	134 752	1	134 780	2	134 785	3	134 1255	1	134 1282	1	134 1307	1	134 1422	1	134 1422	1	134
