Social Theory and Social Structure .A Merton, R.K. Of the four chapters, added to this edition, two come from published symposia,one of which is out of print and the other of which, I am told, is nearing that same state of exhaustion. This chapter sets forth the concept of 'the influential,' identifies two distinctive types of influentials, the 'local' and the 'cosmopolitan,' and relates these types to the structure of influence in the local community. The second of these chapters, "Contributions to the Theory of Reference Group Behavior," draws upon the ample evidence provided by The American Soldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselves to the norms of various groups, in particular the groups with which they are not affiliated. The other two chapters added to this edition have not been published before.  The first of these, "Continuities in the Theory of Social Structure and Anomie," tries to consolidate recent empirical and theoretical analyses of the sources and consequences of that breakdown of social norms which is described as anomie.  The second, "Continuities in the Theory of Reference Groups and Social Structure," tries to bring out some of the specially sociological, as distinct from the socio-psychological, implications of current inquiries into reference-group behavior.  The intent is to examine some of the theoretical problems of social structure which must be solved before certain further advances can be made in the sociological analysis of reference groups.  .X 48	1	1340 102	1	1340 104	1	1340 106	1	1340 110	1	1340 111	1	1340 112	2	1340 113	1	1340 128	1	1340 170	1	1340 173	1	1340 308	2	1340 343	1	1340 456	1	1340 545	1	1340 560	2	1340 646	1	1340 647	1	1340 652	1	1340 793	1	1340 823	1	1340 827	1	1340 888	1	1340 919	1	1340 1003	1	1340 1062	1	1340 1217	2	1340 1234	1	1340 1285	1	1340 1287	1	1340 1291	2	1340 1308	1	1340 1315	1	1340 1331	2	1340 1339	1	1340 1340	11	1340 1344	1	1340 1345	1	1340 1346	2	1340 1347	1	1340 1348	1	1340 1386	2	1340 1445	1	1340 1445	1	1340
