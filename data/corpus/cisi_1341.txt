Communication Nets in Science: Status and Citation Patterns in Animal Physiology .A Whitley, R.D. By virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science, the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance and growth of science.  It is the means by which the individual scientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work to gain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain his knowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for the allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it is a means of exercising social control. The informal communication system, although important, is the distaff side.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory rewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by the social system through informal systems of communication, though it is growing in importance as an information dissemination system. .X 33	1	1341 39	1	1341 41	1	1341 48	1	1341 50	1	1341 89	1	1341 102	2	1341 103	1	1341 104	1	1341 105	1	1341 108	1	1341 113	2	1341 233	2	1341 473	1	1341 632	1	1341 748	1	1341 784	2	1341 791	1	1341 893	2	1341 1082	1	1341 1085	1	1341 1273	1	1341 1274	1	1341 1285	1	1341 1286	1	1341 1287	2	1341 1291	1	1341 1302	1	1341 1304	1	1341 1313	1	1341 1335	1	1341 1338	2	1341 1341	5	1341 1344	1	1341 1346	1	1341 1347	1	1341 1444	1	1341 1444	1	1341
