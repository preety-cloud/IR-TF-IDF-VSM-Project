Problem Areas and Research Networks in Science .A Mulkay, M. J. Gilbert, G. N. Woolgar, S. A general account is presented of the emergence, growth, and decline of scientific research networks and their associated problem areas.. Research networks are seen to pass through three phases.. The first, exploratory phase is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems.. The second phase is one of rapid growth, associated with increasing social and intellectual integration, made possible by improved communication.. An increasingly precise scientific consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation, in which those participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence.. But as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically fruitful; and as the network grows, career opportunities diminish.. Consequently, the third, final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the network, together with the movement of participants to new areas of scientific opportunity.. .X 99	1	1342 103	1	1342 104	1	1342 108	2	1342 170	1	1342 893	1	1342 1063	1	1342 1234	1	1342 1273	1	1342 1274	1	1342 1300	1	1342 1313	1	1342 1315	1	1342 1334	2	1342 1342	6	1342 1343	3	1342 1345	1	1342 1387	1	1342 1444	1	1342 1444	1	1342
