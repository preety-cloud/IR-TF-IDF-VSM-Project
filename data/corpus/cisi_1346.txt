Patterns of Intellectual Influence in Scientific Research .A Cole, Jonathan R. A widespread conception of the development of science holds that the great discoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of scientists.. Those historians and philosophers of science who express this point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral part of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop a pyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists.. An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible for advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National Academy members of today, are the "pedestrians" of history.. This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the field of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawn from a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third from a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by various types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the research produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implications of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas for necessary future research are suggested.. .X 33	1	1346 39	1	1346 48	2	1346 89	4	1346 102	3	1346 104	2	1346 105	3	1346 106	2	1346 110	2	1346 111	2	1346 112	1	1346 113	5	1346 155	1	1346 157	1	1346 161	1	1346 163	1	1346 170	1	1346 243	1	1346 312	1	1346 314	1	1346 356	3	1346 456	1	1346 544	2	1346 545	2	1346 560	4	1346 582	1	1346 592	1	1346 602	1	1346 607	1	1346 632	1	1346 656	1	1346 685	1	1346 784	1	1346 793	1	1346 893	1	1346 1030	2	1346 1050	1	1346 1062	2	1346 1200	1	1346 1234	1	1346 1256	1	1346 1273	1	1346 1280	1	1346 1284	1	1346 1285	4	1346 1286	1	1346 1287	3	1346 1290	1	1346 1291	3	1346 1293	2	1346 1294	1	1346 1295	1	1346 1296	2	1346 1297	1	1346 1298	1	1346 1300	1	1346 1302	2	1346 1308	1	1346 1319	1	1346 1340	2	1346 1341	1	1346 1344	1	1346 1346	9	1346 1347	3	1346 1386	2	1346 1444	1	1346 1444	1	1346
