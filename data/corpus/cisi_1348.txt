Sociology and Modern system Theory .A Buckley, W. This book is intended as an exploratory sketch of a revolutionary scientific perspective and conceptual framework as it might be applied to the sociocultural system.  This point of view and still developing framework, as interpreted here, stems from the General Systems Research movement and the now closely allied fields of cybernetics and information or communication theory.  The principal goal of the book is to bring to the attention of a larger number of social scientists, particularly sociologists, the wealth of principles, ideas, and insights that have already brought a higher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas of biology, psychology, and some physical sciences to say nothing of the applied areas of technology to which they are essential. .X 308	1	1348 435	1	1348 557	1	1348 1036	1	1348 1067	2	1348 1069	1	1348 1333	1	1348 1340	1	1348 1348	7	1348 1389	1	1348 1389	1	1348
