Design of Information Systems and Services .A Borko, H. This review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design of information systems.  Literature dealing with the automation of libraries and information centers has been explicitly excluded, while material on user studies, file organization, evaluation, etc., is only mentioned briefly since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters. The selected, relevant, and available literature that has been published in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows: 1. Articles that help define the process of systems analysis and the relationship to information science. 2. Articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as applied to the analysis and design of information systems. 3. Articles primarily concerned with the design of document storage and retrieval systems. .X 61	1	135 67	1	135 70	1	135 71	1	135 72	1	135 73	1	135 120	2	135 128	1	135 135	5	135 137	1	135 175	1	135 206	1	135 207	1	135 208	1	135 244	1	135 245	1	135 291	1	135 382	1	135 458	1	135 459	1	135 481	1	135 483	1	135 485	1	135 537	1	135 575	1	135 599	1	135 621	1	135 630	1	135 692	1	135 779	1	135 780	1	135 925	1	135 981	1	135 982	1	135 1038	2	135 1358	2	135 1359	1	135 1402	2	135 1410	1	135 1417	1	135 1417	1	135
