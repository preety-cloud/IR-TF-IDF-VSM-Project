The Special Cataloguing .A Horner, J. We feel, meanwhile, that many materials can be covered by general or representative principles and rules.  The content of this book can be viewed as of two types.  Firstly, the first and last chapters deal with special materials in general, the former dealing with basic cataloguing principles and problems, and the latter with the ultimate application of such principles as manifested by the concept of the multi-media catalogue and as aided by the computer.  Secondly, in between come chapters dealing with individual categories of materials in detail.  Each category receives two types of treatment.  First, the problems of both approaches and description are examined as they apply to the particular medium.  Second, the solutions put forward by representative codes are summarized and commented upon. .X 141	1	1351 299	2	1351 333	2	1351 354	1	1351 404	1	1351 522	1	1351 530	1	1351 627	2	1351 628	2	1351 873	1	1351 874	2	1351 875	2	1351 876	1	1351 892	2	1351 941	2	1351 992	1	1351 994	1	1351 995	2	1351 996	1	1351 997	1	1351 998	1	1351 1079	2	1351 1153	1	1351 1189	1	1351 1251	1	1351 1351	7	1351 1396	1	1351 1420	2	1351 1434	2	1351 1435	2	1351 1442	2	1351 1442	2	1351
