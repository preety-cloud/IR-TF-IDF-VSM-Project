Rational Selection of Primary Journals for a Biomedical Research Library: The Use of Secondary Journal Citation .A Windsor, D.A. After considering several different methods, it was concluded that primary journals for coverage of a given field can be selected rationally on the basis of their citation frequencies in an appropriate secondary journal.  Results obtained on the example used, "rehabilitation" as cited in Index Medicus during the years 1968-1971, were similar to those from five other fields, in that the number of journals required for each percent gain in literature coverage increased exponentially as the percentage of literature itself increased.  As a consequence, library coverage of any particular field can be specified as a function of its budgeting commitment, so that the maximum percent coverage will be obtained for each dollar spent. .X 193	1	1355 195	1	1355 196	1	1355 198	1	1355 201	1	1355 219	1	1355 379	1	1355 543	1	1355 588	1	1355 614	2	1355 616	2	1355 638	2	1355 685	1	1355 735	1	1355 764	1	1355 775	1	1355 821	2	1355 905	1	1355 1111	1	1355 1114	1	1355 1275	2	1355 1290	1	1355 1302	3	1355 1355	5	1355 1369	2	1355 1397	1	1355 1397	1	1355
