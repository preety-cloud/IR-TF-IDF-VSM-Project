Freud, Frug, and Feedback .A Shosid, N.J. People ask one another, "Am I communicating?"  The question should be, "What do you think I am communicating?"  The answer would be surprising. Librarians are in the communications business.	Theories of nonverbal communication and role can be adapted to a library situation.  Applied, they would provide a basis for improving librarian-library user communication. Awareness of feedback is the key to this improvement.  Preliminary investigations underway at the University of Southern California indicate the reference encounter provides a investigative approach in which this key can be utilized to enhance communication. .X 270	1	1357 274	2	1357 459	1	1357 532	1	1357 625	1	1357 646	1	1357 826	1	1357 927	1	1357 1008	1	1357 1017	2	1357 1049	1	1357 1263	3	1357 1357	5	1357 1405	1	1357 1405	1	1357
