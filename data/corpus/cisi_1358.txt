System Design, Evaluation, and Costing .A Herner, Saul The word "system" as applied to information programs and activities is one which is very foggily defined.  The purpose of this paper is to help clarify the concept and discuss it in the context of the librarian's conventional planning and administrative activities.  This is done through a narration of the step-by-step procedures followed in the conceptualization and design of an actual library and information program.  The steps involved are the following:  definition of the purpose of the program, and financial and administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged by management; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed audience of the program; analysis and definition of program performance requirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing performance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of program design; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design. Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing, and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs in the design process. .X 29	1	1358 61	1	1358 67	1	1358 70	1	1358 71	1	1358 72	1	1358 73	1	1358 95	1	1358 135	2	1358 175	1	1358 178	1	1358 206	1	1358 207	1	1358 208	1	1358 245	2	1358 249	1	1358 291	1	1358 382	1	1358 408	1	1358 458	1	1358 475	1	1358 481	1	1358 483	1	1358 485	1	1358 779	1	1358 780	1	1358 925	1	1358 967	1	1358 981	1	1358 982	2	1358 1007	1	1358 1038	1	1358 1281	1	1358 1317	2	1358 1358	5	1358 1359	2	1358 1360	1	1358 1400	2	1358 1402	2	1358 1410	1	1358 1417	1	1358 1417	1	1358
