Program Planning and Budget Theory Improved Library Effectiveness by Use of the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System .A Fazar, W. Libraries have a great need to participate more effectively in decisions that influence their capacity to serve their users.  This paper presents a means toward that end.  The relatively new Planning-Programming-Budgeting System is described in the context of its proven utility in the Department of Defense and of its growing utility in the civil sector of organizations.  It describes the system's background; its implementation in the federal government; its spread into non-federal sectors; and the system's methods, including systems analysis, applied economics, and quantitative reasoning.  The paper includes illustrative example of results needed for decision-making by managers, and basic guiding principles for PPBS application. .X 74	2	1360 83	2	1360 245	2	1360 273	1	1360 279	3	1360 288	2	1360 331	1	1360 381	1	1360 408	1	1360 490	1	1360 496	1	1360 584	1	1360 591	1	1360 592	1	1360 723	1	1360 724	1	1360 834	1	1360 860	1	1360 925	2	1360 957	1	1360 975	1	1360 976	2	1360 982	1	1360 1148	1	1360 1183	1	1360 1227	1	1360 1317	2	1360 1353	2	1360 1358	1	1360 1359	3	1360 1360	5	1360 1400	2	1360 1402	1	1360 1410	1	1360 1424	1	1360 1424	1	1360
