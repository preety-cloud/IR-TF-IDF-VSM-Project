The CAN/SDI Project Th SDI Program of Canada's National Science Library .A Brown, J.E. The National Science Library is not a library in the conventional sense of the word but rather an information transferral agency. Its activities are designed to provide the Canadian scientific and industrial communities with direct and immediate access to the publications and information required in their day-to-day work.  Through co-operative measures with both national and international information agencies, the NSL serves as the focal point of a national scientific and technical information network.  The Library employs a variety of mechanized techniques to facilitate the storage, retrieval and dissemination of information.  During the past three years it has operated an SDI service using CT and ISI tapes.  In November 1968 this SDI service, which had been limited to meeting the needs of approximately 170 scientists in the Ottawa area, was expanded to provide a national SDI service.  The author describes the evolution of these services from the local to national level, outlines basic techniques, describes the successes and failures of the system and indicates future developments. .X 13	1	1362 76	1	1362 121	1	1362 213	1	1362 243	1	1362 318	1	1362 329	1	1362 348	1	1362 442	1	1362 450	1	1362 465	1	1362 466	1	1362 491	1	1362 511	1	1362 565	1	1362 567	1	1362 582	1	1362 687	1	1362 720	1	1362 805	1	1362 859	1	1362 866	1	1362 914	1	1362 1087	1	1362 1150	1	1362 1186	1	1362 1285	1	1362 1287	1	1362 1297	1	1362 1302	1	1362 1362	11	1362 1363	2	1362 1363	2	1362
