Current Awareness Publications An Evaluation .A Bloomfield, M. Three types of current awareness publications are defined in terms of their generation and distribution characteristics.  These types are the SDI type, the intermediate type such as NASA's SCAN program, and the unselected type such as the usual library accession list.  A fourth type, the indexing and abstracting journal is defined but not related to the other three types.  The three current awareness publications are shown to have a relationship in terms of the number of requests they can produce from a given set of references or notices.  The SDI system will produce about one request from ten notices; the intermediate type about one request per hundred notices; ad the unselected type, one request per thousand notices.  Despite the differences in the number of notices to generate one request, the cost to produce one request is about the same for the three types of tools.  Also, the usage of these tools is related to the amount of user time available and a curve is presented based on various assumptions to define this relationship. .X 13	1	1363 18	1	1363 34	1	1363 49	1	1363 53	1	1363 59	1	1363 76	1	1363 121	2	1363 164	1	1363 202	1	1363 213	2	1363 224	1	1363 243	1	1363 348	1	1363 421	1	1363 465	2	1363 466	2	1363 490	1	1363 491	1	1363 506	1	1363 507	1	1363 510	1	1363 512	1	1363 582	1	1363 591	1	1363 595	1	1363 603	1	1363 604	1	1363 622	1	1363 623	1	1363 629	1	1363 633	1	1363 639	1	1363 659	1	1363 676	1	1363 711	1	1363 720	1	1363 722	1	1363 723	1	1363 726	1	1363 728	1	1363 730	1	1363 731	1	1363 732	1	1363 809	1	1363 810	1	1363 813	1	1363 814	1	1363 820	1	1363 822	1	1363 828	1	1363 859	1	1363 870	1	1363 879	1	1363 914	1	1363 1091	1	1363 1283	1	1363 1298	1	1363 1299	1	1363 1362	2	1363 1363	5	1363 1366	1	1363 1367	1	1363 1368	1	1363 1396	1	1363 1396	1	1363
