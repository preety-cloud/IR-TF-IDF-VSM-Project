Centralization vs. Decentralization: A Location Analysis Approach for Librarians .A Raffel, J. Shishko, R. An application of location theory to the question of centralized versus decentralized library facilities for a university, with relevance for special libraries is presented.  Locating university libraries near classrooms, offices, and dormitories requires a larger budget than combining these libraries into a centralized facility.  Yet there is a cost to the university community which does not appear in the university budget - a cost in time, energy, and decreased use resulting from locating the library a longer distance from users.  The analysis provides models for a single library, for two or more libraries, or for decentralized facilities. .X 5	1	1365 90	2	1365 91	1	1365 96	1	1365 158	1	1365 222	1	1365 223	1	1365 231	1	1365 261	1	1365 295	1	1365 297	1	1365 298	1	1365 299	1	1365 334	1	1365 354	1	1365 368	1	1365 435	1	1365 494	2	1365 515	2	1365 608	1	1365 610	1	1365 615	1	1365 617	1	1365 620	1	1365 787	1	1365 792	2	1365 815	2	1365 840	2	1365 925	2	1365 938	1	1365 939	1	1365 951	1	1365 952	1	1365 957	1	1365 991	1	1365 992	1	1365 1023	1	1365 1219	1	1365 1221	1	1365 1227	1	1365 1318	1	1365 1339	1	1365 1365	5	1365 1390	2	1365 1400	1	1365 1401	1	1365 1401	1	1365
