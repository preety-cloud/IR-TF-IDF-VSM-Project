Journal Usage Survey Method and Application .A Langlois, D.C. Von Schulz, J.V. A survey of the R.E. Gibson Library's journal collection was conducted to determine 1) which journal titles could be discontinued, 2) which journal holdings could be moved to remote storage, and 3) which journal holdings could be converted to microfilm.  Totals were maintained for three areas of journal usage according to: 1) the number of times patrons used current issues, 2) the number of times the journal issues were reshelved by library staff, and 3) the number of times that journals were cited in articles by Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) authors.  The survey resulted in a 9.6% reduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additional shelf space in which to display journals.  Further studies of the accumulated data are being made to determine which holdings will be sent to a remote storage area which is under construction.  The survey data have been and will continue to be consulted before any journals are converted to microfilm. .X 48	1	1369 167	1	1369 193	2	1369 195	1	1369 196	2	1369 201	2	1369 203	1	1369 204	1	1369 205	2	1369 210	1	1369 219	1	1369 614	4	1369 635	1	1369 638	4	1369 748	1	1369 753	1	1369 756	1	1369 757	1	1369 764	1	1369 787	1	1369 792	1	1369 821	2	1369 831	1	1369 905	1	1369 952	1	1369 953	1	1369 977	1	1369 1083	1	1369 1210	1	1369 1254	1	1369 1256	1	1369 1260	1	1369 1275	2	1369 1278	1	1369 1302	3	1369 1352	1	1369 1355	2	1369 1369	5	1369 1373	1	1369 1397	1	1369 1418	1	1369 1418	1	1369
