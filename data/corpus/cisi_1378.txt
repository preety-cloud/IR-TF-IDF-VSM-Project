Standards for Library Service: An International Survey .A Withers, F.N. In recent years, it has become recognized that a country's documentation and library services, indispensable for all forms of economic, social and cultural development, should be considered as one co-ordinated information system and accordingly included in any national development plans.  However, planning can only be carried out if the necessary statistical data and other information are available.  Unesco therefore concluded a contract in 1968 with the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) for a survey of standards for library services currently recommended for libraries of all types in different countries.  The work was entrusted to F.N. Withers, a research fellow at the Polytechnic of North London School of Librarianship (United Kingdom). .X 234	1	1378 304	1	1378 306	1	1378 338	1	1378 646	1	1378 647	1	1378 651	1	1378 942	1	1378 943	1	1378 944	1	1378 948	1	1378 1017	1	1378 1049	1	1378 1206	1	1378 1237	1	1378 1378	7	1378 1440	1	1378 1450	1	1378 1453	1	1378 1453	1	1378
