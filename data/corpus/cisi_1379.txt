State Library Policy .A Stangelo, D. State library policy is the focus of this study.  The approach to policy is framed in the broadest possible terms currently permitted by empirical research in the examination of governmental policy formation.  A major purpose of the study is to analyze state library policy in relationship to the environment which provides the backdrop for its formation and maintenance.  The authors see this ambitious effort as a pioneering thrust in library research and not as the final work on library policy. .X 214	1	1379 218	1	1379 232	1	1379 241	1	1379 250	1	1379 331	1	1379 340	1	1379 348	1	1379 358	1	1379 375	1	1379 406	1	1379 855	1	1379 896	1	1379 946	1	1379 948	1	1379 986	1	1379 1012	1	1379 1033	1	1379 1079	1	1379 1188	1	1379 1379	6	1379 1403	1	1379 1403	1	1379
