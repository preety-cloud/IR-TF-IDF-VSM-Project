The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology .A Cuadra, C.A. .B 1969 This, the fourth volume of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, is both like and unlike its predecessors.  The basic objective - to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review ever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the basic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues to be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify, locate, and examine interesting and important sources of information about various aspects of our technical progress. Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the first time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on the international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also, the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually covered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this year.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better signposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several major segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of the section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some instances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress. .X 131	3	138 133	3	138 136	3	138 138	6	138 140	4	138 175	1	138 355	1	138 359	1	138 1083	1	138 1327	1	138 1327	1	138
