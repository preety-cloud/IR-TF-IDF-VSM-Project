Statistical Bibliography in Relation to the Growth of Modern Civilization .A Hulme, E.W. The following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures delivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Reader in Bibliography, 1921. As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in library administration and bibliography. Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity in the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this a chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the activities of the human mind. My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical application to library work and the compilation of subject bibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered in relation to the growth of modern civilization. Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends with the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their final interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary qualifications.  I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors which are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.  On this count I offer no defense. .X 19	1	1380 37	2	1380 39	2	1380 40	2	1380 47	1	1380 61	1	1380 88	1	1380 97	2	1380 102	1	1380 103	1	1380 199	1	1380 233	1	1380 253	2	1380 313	1	1380 359	1	1380 377	1	1380 379	4	1380 395	1	1380 470	1	1380 505	1	1380 560	1	1380 573	1	1380 618	3	1380 622	1	1380 632	1	1380 635	1	1380 667	1	1380 748	1	1380 749	2	1380 751	1	1380 764	1	1380 765	2	1380 777	2	1380 778	1	1380 782	1	1380 804	1	1380 805	1	1380 893	1	1380 907	1	1380 925	1	1380 952	1	1380 1016	1	1380 1018	1	1380 1030	1	1380 1032	1	1380 1061	1	1380 1083	1	1380 1085	2	1380 1086	2	1380 1087	2	1380 1182	1	1380 1200	1	1380 1201	1	1380 1255	1	1380 1268	1	1380 1274	1	1380 1275	2	1380 1277	1	1380 1278	1	1380 1280	1	1380 1285	1	1380 1286	1	1380 1287	1	1380 1301	2	1380 1302	3	1380 1304	1	1380 1313	1	1380 1338	1	1380 1344	1	1380 1347	1	1380 1380	8	1380 1428	1	1380 1444	1	1380 1444	1	1380
