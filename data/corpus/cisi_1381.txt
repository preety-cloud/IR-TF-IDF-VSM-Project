Statistical Methods for the Study of Lexicon .A Frumkina, R.M. This book studies the qualitative relations between text and dictionary compilation. Chapter I considers general questions related to the compilation and use of frequency vocabulary; a new Zipf's Law. Chapter III considers various ways of describing the statistical properties of a text and its lexicon, and presents the results of the author's research on the statistic structure of Pushkin's lexicon. Chapter IV considers methods for comparing the vocabulary of texts. A new method for comparing word lists is suggested, which is then used for comparing word lists from the different geures in Pushkin's works. .X 26	1	1381 175	1	1381 361	1	1381 416	1	1381 664	1	1381 759	1	1381 761	1	1381 765	1	1381 1118	1	1381 1159	1	1381 1168	1	1381 1170	1	1381 1172	1	1381 1182	2	1381 1226	2	1381 1267	1	1381 1381	12	1381 1382	1	1381 1382	1	1381
