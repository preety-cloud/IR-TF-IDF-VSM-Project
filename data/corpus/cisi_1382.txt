Statistics and Semantics .A Moskovich, V.A. This monograph is one of the few works in which the possibility of studying semantics using statistical methods is proven with actual research. The semantic field of words denoting color (in English, French, Russian and Ukranian) was chosen as a representative semantic object. The applied aspects of this work are particularly important: the application of those methods tested by the authors for solving problems of automatic information processing, as well as in language translation and instruction. .X 26	2	1382 68	1	1382 77	1	1382 78	1	1382 79	1	1382 175	1	1382 328	1	1382 420	1	1382 422	1	1382 595	1	1382 660	1	1382 662	1	1382 664	1	1382 790	1	1382 1116	1	1382 1118	3	1382 1124	1	1382 1131	1	1382 1177	1	1382 1281	1	1382 1381	1	1382 1382	6	1382 1388	1	1382 1388	1	1382
