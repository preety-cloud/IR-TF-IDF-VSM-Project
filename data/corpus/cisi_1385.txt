Structural Models:  an introduction to the theory of directed graphs .A Harary, F. The purpose of this book is to present an introduction to a body of mathematics concerned with the abstract notion of "structure."  Its preparation has been motivated by the belief that knowledge of the mathematics of abstract structures will be of value to investigators interested in various kinds of empirical structures.  The mathematics with which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs, or more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurations called digraphs, which consist of "points" and "directed lines."  When these terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematical models of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflect structural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematical terms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory has applicability to many different fields of investigation. .X 26	1	1385 109	1	1385 484	1	1385 654	1	1385 855	1	1385 972	1	1385 1232	1	1385 1385	5	1385 1427	1	1385 1427	1	1385
