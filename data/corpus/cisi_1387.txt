The Structure of Scientific Revolutions .A Kuhn, T.S. The essay that follows is the first full published report on a project originally conceived almost fifteen years ago.  At that time I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already within sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvement with an experimental college course treating physical science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success. Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly from scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing avocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow, whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history.  Except for a few articles, this essay is the first of my published works in which these early concerns are dominant.  In some part it is an attempt to explain to myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn from science to its history in the first place. .X 15	1	1387 89	1	1387 101	1	1387 102	1	1387 105	3	1387 172	1	1387 191	1	1387 194	1	1387 212	1	1387 274	1	1387 308	2	1387 343	2	1387 417	2	1387 446	1	1387 458	1	1387 485	1	1387 514	1	1387 546	1	1387 572	1	1387 577	1	1387 579	1	1387 606	1	1387 610	1	1387 611	1	1387 612	1	1387 615	1	1387 626	1	1387 632	1	1387 640	1	1387 902	1	1387 1030	1	1387 1033	1	1387 1063	2	1387 1084	1	1387 1235	1	1387 1273	1	1387 1274	1	1387 1279	1	1387 1285	1	1387 1304	1	1387 1311	1	1387 1313	1	1387 1314	1	1387 1315	1	1387 1316	1	1387 1320	1	1387 1329	1	1387 1334	1	1387 1337	1	1387 1342	1	1387 1343	1	1387 1386	1	1387 1387	19	1387 1444	1	1387 1444	1	1387
