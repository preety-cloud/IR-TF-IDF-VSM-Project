Studies in Ethnomethodology .A Garfinkel, H. In doing sociology, lay and professional, every reference to the "real world," even where the reference is to physical or biological events, is a reference to the organized activities of everyday life. Thereby, in contrast to certain versions of Durkheim that teach that the objective reality of social facts is sociology's fundamental principle, the lesson is taken instead, and used as study policy, that the objective reality of social facts as an ongoing accomplishment of the concerted activities of daily life, with the ordinary, artful ways of that accomplishment being by members known, used, ad taken for granted, is, for members doing sociology, a fundamental phenomenon.  Because, and in the ways it is practical sociology's fundamental phenomenon, it is the prevailing topic for ethno-methodological study.  Ethnomethodological studies analyze everyday activities as members' methods for making those same activities visibly-rational- and-reportable-for-all-practical-purposes, i.e., "accountable," as organizations of commonplace everyday activities.  The reflexivity of that phenomenon is a singular feature of practical actions, of practical circumstances, of common sense knowledge of social structures, and of practical sociological reasoning.  By permitting us to locate and examine their occurrence the reflexivity of that phenomenon establishes their study. .X 105	1	1389 168	1	1389 572	1	1389 590	1	1389 1030	1	1389 1045	1	1389 1046	1	1389 1047	1	1389 1063	1	1389 1213	1	1389 1227	1	1389 1312	1	1389 1329	1	1389 1348	1	1389 1386	1	1389 1389	5	1389 1443	1	1389 1443	1	1389
