Information Needs and Uses .A Allen, T.J. Previous authors in this series, writing on this subject, have usually felt it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the methodology of "user" studies.  They have, for the most part, found it improved over the past, and this year is no exception in that regard. There remains, however, the tendency on the part of many who are untrained in social science methodology to assume that the art of questionnaire design and administration is a very simple one that anyone with intelligence can master in a single attempt.  One never realizes how truly wrong this view is until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers. .X 2	1	139 15	1	139 76	1	139 120	1	139 132	2	139 137	3	139 139	5	139 152	1	139 155	1	139 183	1	139 195	1	139 203	1	139 204	1	139 210	1	139 356	1	139 475	1	139 552	1	139 760	1	139 774	1	139 775	1	139 788	1	139 789	1	139 977	1	139 1050	1	139 1055	1	139 1056	1	139 1101	1	139 1178	1	139 1186	1	139 1187	1	139 1333	1	139 1451	1	139 1451	1	139
