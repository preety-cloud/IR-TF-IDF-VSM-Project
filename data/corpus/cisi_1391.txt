A Study of General Categories Applicable to Classification and Coding in Documentation .A Grolier, E.D. The rapid development of information retrieval methods since the last war - together with the development of systems using mechanical or electromechanical means (punched cards) for such purposes followed later by electronic retrieval (computers) - have led to transformations in the structure of classification or coding systems for books and documents.  Generally speaking, document specialists have tended to elaborate a large number of different codes, usually totally unrelated to each other, each conceived to meet the special documentation requirements of a particular organization.  This is farther than ever - at least to all appearances - from the original intention of 1895 of the founders of the Institut International de Bibliographie (now known as the Federation Internationale de Documentation), i.e., the standardization of classification methods. .X 75	1	1391 154	2	1391 258	2	1391 259	1	1391 263	1	1391 388	1	1391 476	2	1391 477	5	1391 480	1	1391 516	1	1391 542	1	1391 653	2	1391 758	2	1391 838	4	1391 898	2	1391 1066	1	1391 1074	2	1391 1075	2	1391 1231	2	1391 1259	4	1391 1391	9	1391 1394	1	1391 1402	2	1391 1405	1	1391 1414	1	1391 1429	4	1391 1430	4	1391 1430	4	1391
