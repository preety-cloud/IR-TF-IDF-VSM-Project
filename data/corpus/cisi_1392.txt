Subject Analysis: Computer Implications of Rigorous Definator .A Harris, J.L. Subject analysis for information retrieval is an area which always seems deceptively simple to those without previous background in it, however extensive their background in specific subject disciplines may be.  The basic requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and retrieved from, an ordered file. While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex terms or even single words, it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex. To express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined, or that only one part of the subject be shown. The former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the concept an entry should be made. .X 16	1	1392 114	2	1392 154	1	1392 169	1	1392 194	1	1392 212	1	1392 235	1	1392 250	1	1392 289	2	1392 345	1	1392 400	1	1392 404	1	1392 458	1	1392 459	1	1392 493	1	1392 548	1	1392 627	2	1392 770	1	1392 796	1	1392 802	1	1392 863	1	1392 864	1	1392 897	1	1392 990	1	1392 1073	1	1392 1152	1	1392 1368	1	1392 1392	8	1392 1414	1	1392 1431	1	1392 1448	2	1392 1448	2	1392
