The Subject Approach to Information .A Foskett, A.C. The first edition of this book, published in 1969, was prompted by changes in the Library Association syllabus which for the first time enables lecturers to treat classification and subject cataloging as different aspects of the same topic.  These changes coincided with the publication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showed clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same.  However, although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was no one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I felt was needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and its reception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill a real need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and - more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States, where British textbooks on classification had previously been regarded with something akin to suspicion.  (As the Dean of one American library school is alleged to have remarked, 'What theory of classification?') .X 30	1	1393 71	1	1393 75	1	1393 77	1	1393 78	1	1393 79	1	1393 80	1	1393 81	1	1393 82	1	1393 83	1	1393 146	1	1393 154	1	1393 212	1	1393 247	1	1393 249	1	1393 257	1	1393 458	1	1393 581	1	1393 666	1	1393 715	1	1393 797	1	1393 798	1	1393 838	1	1393 853	1	1393 911	1	1393 930	1	1393 966	1	1393 1043	1	1393 1053	1	1393 1066	2	1393 1230	1	1393 1231	1	1393 1265	1	1393 1393	10	1393 1394	1	1393 1431	1	1393 1431	1	1393
