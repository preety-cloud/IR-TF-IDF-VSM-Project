Subject Catalogues Heading and Structure .A Coates, E.J. In 1955 the Publications Committee of the Library Association approached my chief, Mr. A.J. Wells, with a request that he should write a book on subject cataloguing.  At the time, Mr. Wells was preoccupied with the inauguration of the British National Bibliography Card Service, and he made the suggestion, which was agreed by the Committee, that I should undertake the task.  The result is scarcely an adequate substitute for the book which Mr. Wells would have written. Nevertheless, he has had a major part in shaping my views on subject cataloguing, and in this sense the present book stems back to him, though he might not subscribe to all the views now put forward. .X 42	1	1394 152	1	1394 154	1	1394 160	1	1394 257	2	1394 260	1	1394 324	1	1394 476	1	1394 477	1	1394 558	1	1394 600	1	1394 653	1	1394 714	1	1394 715	1	1394 746	1	1394 761	1	1394 781	1	1394 797	1	1394 798	1	1394 825	1	1394 901	1	1394 907	1	1394 1066	1	1394 1230	1	1394 1231	1	1394 1255	1	1394 1265	2	1394 1391	1	1394 1393	1	1394 1394	8	1394 1395	1	1394 1407	1	1394 1422	1	1394 1429	1	1394 1430	1	1394 1430	1	1394
