Subject Headings: A Practical Guide .A Haykin, D.J. The alphabetical subject catalog, either self-contained, or as the subject element in the dictionary catalog, is a later development that the systematic, or classed, catalog (Realkatalog, catalogue raisonne).  In this country it has almost completely displaced the latter.  The principal classed catalogs now remaining are those of the Engineering Societies Library in New York, the John Crerar Library in Chicago, and the Science and Technology Department of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  There are, nevertheless, many things to commend the classed catalog.  Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument between the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical catalog is concerned.  However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for one not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no approach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library's collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced. .X 79	1	1395 92	1	1395 159	1	1395 235	1	1395 246	1	1395 247	1	1395 324	1	1395 326	1	1395 333	1	1395 354	1	1395 361	1	1395 382	1	1395 502	1	1395 608	1	1395 825	1	1395 838	1	1395 874	1	1395 884	1	1395 887	1	1395 892	1	1395 950	1	1395 966	1	1395 970	1	1395 991	1	1395 997	2	1395 998	1	1395 1000	1	1395 1153	1	1395 1216	2	1395 1265	1	1395 1266	2	1395 1394	1	1395 1395	9	1395 1421	1	1395 1441	1	1395 1445	1	1395 1445	1	1395
