Switching and Finite Automata Theory .A Kohavi, Z. The subject of switching and finite automata theory needs no introduction. It has become a part of every computer science and electrical engineering curriculum, and rightly so.  It provides techniques useful in a wide variety of applications and helps develop a way of thinking that leads to understanding of the structure, behavior, and limitations and capabilities of logical machines.  In this book I have tried to cover the whole subject, starting with introductory material and leading to the more advanced topics, assuming a minimal technical background on the part of the reader.  I did not attempt to provide detailed techniques for the design of specific circuits, but rather to formulate methods and to develop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems. For once such general principles are understood, the relevance of specific procedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter of engineering decisions. .X 228	1	1398 329	1	1398 397	3	1398 416	1	1398 417	3	1398 430	4	1398 442	1	1398 443	4	1398 455	4	1398 464	3	1398 495	1	1398 511	1	1398 524	1	1398 745	4	1398 1194	1	1398 1204	3	1398 1396	1	1398 1398	5	1398 1427	3	1398 1427	3	1398
