Syntactic Structures .A Chomsky, N. This study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense (as opposed to semantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed to phonemics and morphology).  It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to explore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established methods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed. Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects. .X 21	1	1399 118	1	1399 149	1	1399 168	5	1399 175	1	1399 317	3	1399 320	1	1399 332	1	1399 417	1	1399 443	1	1399 546	1	1399 558	2	1399 572	2	1399 608	1	1399 628	1	1399 653	1	1399 902	2	1399 1046	3	1399 1118	1	1399 1265	1	1399 1310	1	1399 1327	1	1399 1386	1	1399 1399	11	1399 1443	1	1399 1443	1	1399
