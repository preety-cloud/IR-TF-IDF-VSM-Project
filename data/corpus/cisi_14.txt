The Administration of the College Library .A Lyle, G.R. If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but frequently neglected principle that college library service goes beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching process with reference service, to afford faculty members library opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a service activity, a tool through which library functions are more fully and efficiently realized. The present work retains most of the material of the first edition, but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in some cases extended. .X 14	6	14 132	1	14 137	1	14 153	1	14 170	1	14 223	1	14 237	1	14 266	1	14 271	1	14 272	1	14 302	1	14 550	1	14 767	1	14 772	1	14 952	1	14 1019	1	14 1028	1	14 1030	1	14 1086	1	14 1090	1	14 1275	1	14 1280	1	14 1424	3	14 1424	3	14
