Systems Approach .A Churchman, C.W. There is no question that in our age there is a good deal of turmoil about the manner in which our society is run.  Probably at no prior point in the history of man has there been so much discussion about the rights and wrongs of the policy makers, whether they be the politicians in Albany or Sacramento, in Washington, Paris, or Moscow, the managers of far-flung industrial firms, or the people who run educational institutions.  In all cases the citizen feels a perfect right to have his say about the way in which the managers manage. Not only has the citizen become far more vocal, but he has also in many instances begun to suspect that the people who make the major decisions that affect our lives don't know what they are doing.  They don't know what they are doing simply because they have no adequate basis to judge the effects of their decisions. .X 3	2	1402 61	1	1402 67	1	1402 70	1	1402 71	1	1402 72	1	1402 73	1	1402 75	1	1402 120	1	1402 128	1	1402 135	2	1402 154	2	1402 172	1	1402 175	1	1402 206	1	1402 207	1	1402 208	1	1402 244	1	1402 245	2	1402 291	1	1402 292	1	1402 350	1	1402 360	1	1402 382	1	1402 435	1	1402 458	1	1402 459	1	1402 477	1	1402 481	1	1402 483	1	1402 485	1	1402 575	1	1402 599	1	1402 621	1	1402 630	1	1402 692	1	1402 779	1	1402 780	1	1402 838	2	1402 898	1	1402 907	2	1402 925	2	1402 981	1	1402 982	2	1402 1067	1	1402 1074	2	1402 1075	2	1402 1219	1	1402 1268	1	1402 1317	1	1402 1358	2	1402 1359	1	1402 1360	1	1402 1391	2	1402 1400	1	1402 1402	10	1402 1410	1	1402 1417	1	1402 1426	1	1402 1429	2	1402 1430	2	1402 1456	1	1402 1456	1	1402
