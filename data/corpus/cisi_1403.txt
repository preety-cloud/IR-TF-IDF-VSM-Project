Targets for Research in Library Education .A Borko, H. Few librarians and library educators who criticize research relating to their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed during the last decade and a half.  The criticism usually relates to the recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact- finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  One can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on original research or the writing of proposals, which either are not adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  If the librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited interest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work there are no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusions into action. .X 128	1	1403 130	1	1403 171	1	1403 191	1	1403 217	1	1403 230	1	1403 232	1	1403 241	1	1403 243	1	1403 249	1	1403 331	1	1403 339	3	1403 358	1	1403 364	1	1403 370	1	1403 371	1	1403 376	1	1403 385	1	1403 387	3	1403 406	1	1403 453	1	1403 598	1	1403 616	1	1403 629	1	1403 648	1	1403 652	1	1403 779	1	1403 896	1	1403 923	1	1403 924	1	1403 946	1	1403 948	1	1403 1033	1	1403 1079	1	1403 1242	1	1403 1250	1	1403 1376	1	1403 1379	1	1403 1403	14	1403 1423	1	1403 1428	1	1403 1457	1	1403 1457	1	1403
