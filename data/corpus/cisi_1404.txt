Technical Libraries; users and their demands: a classification of user groups and user demands in technical libraries .A Slater, M. This study of the habits of customers of technical libraries and information departments had three main aims. 1. Determination of user demands:  to discover what items of information or documents customers seek, why they seek them and how they obtain them. 2. Classification of user groups and their demands:  to test a hypothesis; that it is possible to classify customers into meaningful user groups possessing recognizable common features and characteristic behavior patterns, and to classify group needs. 3. Estimation of the significance of the above for librarians: to measure the demand on librarians and libraries, in terms of expenditure of their time and skill, and use of stock made by different user groups. .X 24	1	1404 62	1	1404 65	1	1404 66	1	1404 75	1	1404 76	1	1404 137	1	1404 147	2	1404 161	1	1404 165	1	1404 210	2	1404 278	1	1404 279	1	1404 280	1	1404 355	1	1404 371	1	1404 382	1	1404 386	1	1404 395	1	1404 398	1	1404 475	1	1404 560	1	1404 614	1	1404 658	2	1404 716	1	1404 748	1	1404 760	1	1404 763	1	1404 770	1	1404 776	1	1404 782	1	1404 788	2	1404 789	1	1404 837	1	1404 889	1	1404 925	1	1404 967	1	1404 986	1	1404 1050	1	1404 1083	1	1404 1089	1	1404 1254	1	1404 1291	1	1404 1361	1	1404 1400	1	1404 1404	5	1404 1404	5	1404
