Technology; economic growth and public policy .A Nelson, R.R. This book explores the relations among research, development, innovation, and economic growth; considers the manner in which the economy adapts to technical change and the problems encountered in the processes of adaption; and recommends several policy changes designed to encourage technological change consistent with other public policy objectives.  Since they address policy makers as well as scholars, the authors have tried to avoid scholarly jargon without sacrificing scholarly rigor. .X 312	1	1406 356	1	1406 369	1	1406 436	1	1406 437	1	1406 1036	1	1406 1041	1	1406 1148	1	1406 1154	1	1406 1187	1	1406 1227	1	1406 1333	1	1406 1339	1	1406 1345	1	1406 1406	5	1406 1406	5	1406
