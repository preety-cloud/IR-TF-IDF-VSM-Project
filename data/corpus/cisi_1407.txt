Technology, Information, and Organization Information Transfer in Industrial R and D .A Rosenbloom, R. S. This is an empirical study of information transfer in the R&D operations of large industrial corporations.. Its basis is a body of survey data collected from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations and from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work.. While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational, and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the information was applied.. The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions, one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational objectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal sources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on "professional" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge.. In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have, within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the need for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in this process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formal and social groups.. Firms need to establish two-way communication about needs and  possibilities; by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the needs of society.. .X 4	1	1407 9	1	1407 32	1	1407 42	1	1407 96	1	1407 137	1	1407 152	1	1407 163	1	1407 206	1	1407 207	2	1407 208	1	1407 270	1	1407 272	1	1407 356	1	1407 456	1	1407 714	1	1407 761	1	1407 768	1	1407 774	1	1407 783	1	1407 799	1	1407 811	1	1407 816	1	1407 907	1	1407 913	1	1407 925	1	1407 961	1	1407 962	1	1407 964	1	1407 968	1	1407 1068	1	1407 1203	1	1407 1205	1	1407 1317	1	1407 1321	3	1407 1394	1	1407 1407	5	1407 1445	1	1407 1445	1	1407
