Technology and Information Transfer .A Rosenbloom, R.S. In 1963 research at the Harvard Business School was initiated by Richard Rosenbloom and Frank Wolek to describe the process by which technical information is communicated and used.  National and corporate attention had been increasingly drawn to the interaction between scientific and technological advance and social change.  This problem was considered to be of considerable practical importance at that time, as it still is.  This volume is a product of that effort.  The research focuses upon the flow of technical information across organizational lines in the research and development operations of large industrial corporations.  The basis of the work is a body of survey data collected from 2,000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of 4 corporations, and from 1,200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues.  The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work. .X 15	2	1408 95	1	1408 96	1	1408 98	1	1408 105	2	1408 109	1	1408 313	1	1408 386	1	1408 398	1	1408 544	1	1408 560	1	1408 658	1	1408 771	1	1408 965	1	1408 1037	1	1408 1048	1	1408 1063	1	1408 1154	1	1408 1186	1	1408 1187	1	1408 1188	1	1408 1284	1	1408 1300	1	1408 1321	2	1408 1408	7	1408 1408	7	1408
