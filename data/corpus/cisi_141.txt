Application of Computer Technology to Library Process: a syllabus .A Becker, J. The application of computer technology to library and network processes and services is not an end in itself, but rather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand for library services and the ability of libraries to provide those services.  Libraries have assumed the active role of serving the informational, educational and recreational needs of the population.  The size of that population grows constantly, its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of leisure time is increasing. The application of computer technology to libraries, especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in the performance of library functions, is a complex process and demands the highest level of talent of both the library and computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at least a general overview of what library automation is all about. .X 141	7	141 244	1	141 299	2	141 333	1	141 363	1	141 365	1	141 409	1	141 522	1	141 529	1	141 530	1	141 627	1	141 628	1	141 630	1	141 645	1	141 647	1	141 651	1	141 739	1	141 822	1	141 854	1	141 871	1	141 872	1	141 873	2	141 874	2	141 875	2	141 876	2	141 877	1	141 878	1	141 879	1	141 880	1	141 881	1	141 882	1	141 883	1	141 884	1	141 885	1	141 886	1	141 887	1	141 892	2	141 917	1	141 940	1	141 941	2	141 990	1	141 994	2	141 995	1	141 996	1	141 997	2	141 998	2	141 999	1	141 1000	1	141 1001	1	141 1002	1	141 1003	1	141 1004	1	141 1079	2	141 1143	1	141 1153	1	141 1189	1	141 1230	1	141 1251	1	141 1257	1	141 1303	1	141 1351	1	141 1375	1	141 1376	1	141 1396	2	141 1420	1	141 1434	1	141 1435	2	141 1436	1	141 1442	1	141 1442	1	141
