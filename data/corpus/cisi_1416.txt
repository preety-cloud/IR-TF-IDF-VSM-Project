Synthesis, Identification and Control of Distributed Parameter Systems .A Jain, Anil Kumar Many synthesis, identification and control problems that arise in distributed parameter systems are studied.. Two major approaches, viz., the frequency domain approach and the time domain approach, are considered.. The techniques developed overcome many difficulties that are associated with optimization problems in distributed parameter systems.. In the frequency domain, distributed systems described by the general (linear) telegrapher's equations are considered, over a finite band of frequencies.. An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed.. Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulated in terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles of lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems.. Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are discussed.. In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method of solution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systems are considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along the characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages.. It is shown that solving for Green's function (and associated eigenvalue problem) is not required.. It is hoped that the methods developed here will lead efficiently to actual realization of optimal distributed systems.. .X 36	1	1416 46	2	1416 61	1	1416 62	1	1416 67	1	1416 222	1	1416 267	2	1416 269	2	1416 280	1	1416 290	1	1416 494	1	1416 515	1	1416 587	1	1416 792	1	1416 823	1	1416 840	1	1416 925	4	1416 948	1	1416 1019	2	1416 1187	1	1416 1203	1	1416 1219	1	1416 1324	1	1416 1400	1	1416 1416	6	1416 1417	3	1416 1417	3	1416
