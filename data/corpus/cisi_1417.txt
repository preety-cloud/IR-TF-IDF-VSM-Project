Least Cost Decision Rules for the Selection of Library Materials for Compact Storage .A Lister, Winston Charles For the last several decades library collections have been growing at exponential rates with no relief evident in the future.. To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections, many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials.. Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared.. For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average geometric pattern of obsolescence.. The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon the circulation activities of the individual libraries.. An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored.. Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit relocation cost.. Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules.. .X 31	1	1417 33	1	1417 36	3	1417 41	2	1417 46	3	1417 57	1	1417 61	1	1417 62	2	1417 67	2	1417 70	1	1417 71	1	1417 72	1	1417 73	1	1417 81	1	1417 89	1	1417 97	1	1417 102	1	1417 111	1	1417 112	1	1417 115	1	1417 135	1	1417 163	1	1417 172	1	1417 175	1	1417 181	1	1417 182	1	1417 183	2	1417 184	3	1417 193	3	1417 195	2	1417 198	1	1417 199	1	1417 201	2	1417 203	2	1417 204	1	1417 205	1	1417 206	1	1417 207	1	1417 208	1	1417 210	1	1417 222	1	1417 225	1	1417 233	1	1417 267	3	1417 269	3	1417 280	1	1417 359	1	1417 360	1	1417 373	1	1417 382	1	1417 395	2	1417 415	1	1417 435	1	1417 458	1	1417 471	1	1417 481	1	1417 483	1	1417 485	1	1417 494	1	1417 515	1	1417 545	1	1417 552	1	1417 587	3	1417 605	1	1417 613	1	1417 614	1	1417 638	1	1417 667	1	1417 735	1	1417 747	1	1417 748	1	1417 750	2	1417 751	1	1417 753	1	1417 759	1	1417 760	1	1417 765	1	1417 766	1	1417 767	3	1417 774	1	1417 775	1	1417 778	2	1417 779	1	1417 780	1	1417 782	1	1417 784	1	1417 786	1	1417 787	1	1417 788	1	1417 789	1	1417 791	1	1417 792	2	1417 793	2	1417 800	2	1417 808	1	1417 823	1	1417 840	2	1417 891	1	1417 905	2	1417 907	1	1417 925	4	1417 948	1	1417 952	1	1417 953	2	1417 964	1	1417 968	1	1417 977	1	1417 981	1	1417 982	1	1417 983	2	1417 1009	1	1417 1016	1	1417 1018	1	1417 1019	3	1417 1023	1	1417 1030	1	1417 1055	1	1417 1081	1	1417 1082	2	1417 1083	1	1417 1085	1	1417 1086	1	1417 1087	1	1417 1090	1	1417 1135	1	1417 1184	1	1417 1187	1	1417 1201	1	1417 1203	1	1417 1219	3	1417 1240	1	1417 1260	1	1417 1268	1	1417 1275	1	1417 1276	1	1417 1278	2	1417 1280	1	1417 1285	1	1417 1286	1	1417 1287	1	1417 1302	1	1417 1324	1	1417 1335	1	1417 1358	1	1417 1359	1	1417 1390	1	1417 1397	2	1417 1400	1	1417 1401	2	1417 1402	1	1417 1410	1	1417 1416	3	1417 1417	13	1417 1418	3	1417 1426	1	1417 1428	1	1417 1432	1	1417 1450	1	1417 1450	1	1417
