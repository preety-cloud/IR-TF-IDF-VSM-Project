Utility of Automatic Classification Systems for Information Storage and Retrieval .A Litofsky, Barry Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous problems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical of these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and advantages.. The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies.. By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the indexing method used.. It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied, one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the aforementioned file.. The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included as an appendix to this dissertation.. .X 45	1	1419 51	1	1419 62	1	1419 69	1	1419 71	1	1419 77	1	1419 79	1	1419 86	1	1419 168	1	1419 174	1	1419 175	2	1419 176	1	1419 310	2	1419 315	1	1419 318	1	1419 324	1	1419 363	1	1419 382	2	1419 389	1	1419 390	1	1419 409	1	1419 422	1	1419 448	1	1419 454	1	1419 462	1	1419 479	1	1419 480	1	1419 483	2	1419 484	1	1419 485	1	1419 486	1	1419 488	1	1419 491	1	1419 493	1	1419 503	1	1419 507	1	1419 509	1	1419 510	1	1419 512	1	1419 514	1	1419 517	1	1419 520	2	1419 522	1	1419 527	1	1419 528	1	1419 531	1	1419 564	1	1419 565	1	1419 566	1	1419 570	1	1419 576	1	1419 581	1	1419 586	1	1419 596	1	1419 603	1	1419 604	1	1419 608	2	1419 633	1	1419 636	1	1419 643	1	1419 659	2	1419 661	1	1419 662	1	1419 663	1	1419 678	1	1419 682	1	1419 715	1	1419 737	1	1419 754	1	1419 769	1	1419 790	1	1419 805	1	1419 809	1	1419 810	1	1419 812	1	1419 813	1	1419 814	1	1419 817	1	1419 820	1	1419 824	1	1419 825	1	1419 853	1	1419 875	1	1419 883	1	1419 894	2	1419 1051	1	1419 1274	1	1419 1294	1	1419 1313	1	1419 1327	3	1419 1419	7	1419 1427	1	1419 1427	1	1419
