Time-Lag in Cataloging .A Pope, S.E. Any who have the arduous task of assisting a student through that ultimate of academic exercises, the preparation and defense of a dissertation, are likely to define happiness as a good book written by an advisee.  This book is a cause of joy.  The author expended much more effort than is usually the case to gain even the smallest detail, because the subject matter is strangely intractable, hedged round with perplexities and not a few vested interests.  Letters and reports get locked away where they may not be seen except by the most persistent investigator and one who somehow meets criteria that no one else can claim.  In the end, the author deserves the praise and the advisor is well rewarded with the inner satisfaction that comes from participation in an important investigation finished as an influential and well-written book. .X 141	1	1420 299	2	1420 333	2	1420 522	1	1420 530	1	1420 627	2	1420 628	2	1420 873	1	1420 874	2	1420 875	2	1420 876	1	1420 892	2	1420 941	2	1420 994	1	1420 995	2	1420 996	1	1420 997	1	1420 998	1	1420 1079	2	1420 1153	1	1420 1189	1	1420 1251	1	1420 1351	2	1420 1396	1	1420 1420	6	1420 1434	2	1420 1435	2	1420 1442	2	1420 1442	2	1420
