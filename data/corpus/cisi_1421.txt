Title Derivative Indexing Techniques; a comparative study .A Feinberg, H. The increasing volume of published literature continues to present problems in relation to information handling and information representation. As the magnitude and complexity of the available information has continued to increase, investigators have examined means of reducing the costly and time-consuming processes involved when human beings assign index terms to documents.  Recognition of the general inadequacy of present indexing, and concern over time and cost factors in index preparation have prompted experimentation in the development and application of machines to assist in the indexing process.  As a result, use of suitable mechanized or partly mechanized procedures to replace or complement the manual indexing process has become more widespread.  Machine indexing is a process whereby mechanized or automatic selection or generation of indexing terms is accomplished.  The present study investigates one aspect of automatic computer-based indexing, the permuted title index. .X 38	1	1421 52	1	1421 79	1	1421 150	1	1421 333	1	1421 361	1	1421 382	1	1421 449	1	1421 530	1	1421 553	1	1421 589	1	1421 603	1	1421 608	1	1421 628	1	1421 722	1	1421 802	1	1421 819	1	1421 825	1	1421 830	1	1421 874	1	1421 877	1	1421 878	1	1421 940	1	1421 941	1	1421 966	1	1421 992	1	1421 993	1	1421 995	1	1421 997	1	1421 1079	1	1421 1144	1	1421 1195	1	1421 1216	2	1421 1266	1	1421 1395	1	1421 1421	6	1421 1434	1	1421 1435	1	1421 1436	1	1421 1436	1	1421
