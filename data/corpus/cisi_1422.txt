Towards Information Retrieval .A Fairthorne, R.A. The selection of papers published here explores activities in which indefinite neglect of either aspect, the conceptual or the mechanical, will lead to practical and theoretical disaster.  They centre on the recovery of records according to their subject matter. Since libraries began, librarians have evolved, studied, and taught procedures for indexing and classifying.  These allow some delegation from subject specialists who understand the subject matter, to library staff who can recognize the ways in which specialists talk about it.  The procedures consider mostly only the interpretation of texts, not the text itself as an object with recognizable marks subject to the laws of physics and the principles of engineering. They assume the problems of topic identification solved, and the methods for recovering physical texts as independent of the methods for describing the interpretations of texts. .X 73	1	1422 134	1	1422 160	1	1422 233	1	1422 306	1	1422 474	1	1422 477	1	1422 558	1	1422 566	1	1422 600	1	1422 653	1	1422 665	2	1422 746	1	1422 748	1	1422 765	1	1422 780	1	1422 781	1	1422 785	1	1422 786	1	1422 789	1	1422 791	1	1422 795	1	1422 901	1	1422 1030	1	1422 1045	1	1422 1250	1	1422 1307	1	1422 1386	1	1422 1394	1	1422 1422	7	1422 1422	7	1422
