Training for Library Service:  a report prepared for the Carnegie Corporation of New York .A Williamson, C.C. The primary purpose in preparing the following report was to present existing conditions in this country with respect to training for library work in such a way that the educator and the layman interested in educational problems might be able to form a true conception of the steps that should be taken to improve this phase of the library situation. The author has been obliged to limit the scope of his study to the so-called professional schools.  He has treated only incidentally training classes, summer schools, and other types of library training agency.  An effort has been made to discover and to point out the strong and weak points in the organization of these library schools and in the training which they offer.  Many of the defects disclosed could be remedied by the schools themselves; others are due to extreme poverty and can be remedied only by increased income. .X 22	1	1423 171	1	1423 230	2	1423 274	1	1423 339	1	1423 387	2	1423 470	1	1423 585	1	1423 832	1	1423 934	1	1423 954	1	1423 1154	1	1423 1280	1	1423 1285	1	1423 1403	1	1423 1423	12	1423 1423	12	1423
