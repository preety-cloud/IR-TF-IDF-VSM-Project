University Library Administration .A Rogers, R.D. A university library is both a collegiate library and a research library. It is collegiate in its provision of books and other documentary records to support the students' program of instruction and to encourage the habit of reading and the use of libraries.  As does the college library, the university library must also provide materials for use by the faculty members in the preparation of their courses of instruction and by the staff of the institution in the performance of their administrative responsibilities. However, the university library differs from the college library in offering a wider range of undergraduate programs, offering graduate instruction beyond the Master's level, and usually offering advanced professional programs in a number of fields. .X 7	1	1424 14	3	1424 74	1	1424 83	1	1424 153	1	1424 170	1	1424 223	1	1424 240	1	1424 245	1	1424 262	1	1424 266	1	1424 271	1	1424 273	1	1424 279	1	1424 288	1	1424 302	1	1424 331	1	1424 340	1	1424 381	1	1424 408	1	1424 431	1	1424 490	1	1424 496	1	1424 550	1	1424 559	1	1424 591	1	1424 592	1	1424 723	1	1424 724	1	1424 834	1	1424 843	1	1424 844	1	1424 860	1	1424 925	1	1424 939	1	1424 955	1	1424 957	1	1424 976	1	1424 1009	1	1424 1019	1	1424 1028	2	1424 1086	1	1424 1090	1	1424 1148	1	1424 1211	1	1424 1212	1	1424 1227	1	1424 1266	1	1424 1317	1	1424 1353	1	1424 1359	1	1424 1360	1	1424 1390	1	1424 1400	1	1424 1410	1	1424 1424	10	1424 1424	10	1424
