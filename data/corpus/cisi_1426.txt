Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man .A Mcluhan, M With the advent of individual detribalized man, a new education was needed.  Plato devised such a new program for literate men.  It was based on the Ideas.  With the phonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from the operational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal encyclopedia.  Education by classified data has been the Western program ever since. Now, however, in the electronic age, data classification yields to pattern recognition, the key phrase at IBM.  When data moves instantly, classification is too fragmentary.  In order to cope with data at electric speed in typical situations of "information overload," men resort to the study of configurations, like the sailor in Edgar Allan Poe's Maelstrom. "The medium is the message" means, in terms of the electronic age, that a totally new environment has been created.  The "content" of this new environment is the old mechanized environment of the industrial age. .X 3	1	1426 39	1	1426 50	1	1426 59	1	1426 62	1	1426 63	1	1426 120	1	1426 140	1	1426 172	3	1426 175	1	1426 326	1	1426 355	1	1426 360	2	1426 446	1	1426 473	1	1426 481	1	1426 482	1	1426 485	1	1426 503	1	1426 572	1	1426 616	1	1426 632	1	1426 717	1	1426 718	1	1426 719	1	1426 773	1	1426 907	3	1426 958	1	1426 980	1	1426 1042	1	1426 1051	1	1426 1207	1	1426 1219	2	1426 1268	2	1426 1283	1	1426 1402	1	1426 1410	1	1426 1415	1	1426 1417	1	1426 1418	1	1426 1426	8	1426 1426	8	1426
