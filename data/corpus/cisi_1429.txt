The Universal Decimal Classification .A Kyle, B. Purpose of this paper.  The purpose of this preliminary study is to attempt to discover how far it succeeds at present and how far and by what methods it may continue to succeed or be made to succeed in the future.  One person (or two, for Brian Vickery is tackling the problem from the point of view of scientific and technological users) with however many helpful consultants can only hope to isolate some of the problems and to indicate some of the possible solutions.  This, it is hoped, may prepare the ground and stimulate the critical and creative efforts of others towards fruitful developments. .X 75	1	1429 154	3	1429 257	1	1429 260	1	1429 476	2	1429 477	3	1429 653	2	1429 838	4	1429 898	2	1429 1066	1	1429 1074	2	1429 1075	2	1429 1231	1	1429 1255	1	1429 1259	2	1429 1391	4	1429 1394	1	1429 1402	2	1429 1429	5	1429 1430	5	1429 1430	5	1429
