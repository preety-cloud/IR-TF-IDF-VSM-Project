The Area Specialist Bibliographer: an inquiry into his role .A Stuart, R.D. It is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed to eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and to improve administrative procedures for future development of area programs.  This will be accomplished by giving some indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialist bibliographers and by isolating factors which influence these opinions.  These attitudes will be presented by the perceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and the expectations of faculty and library administrators toward that role.  The bibliographer's academic, professional, and educational experience will be examined in this framework. .X 11	1	143 143	5	143 268	1	143 305	1	143 1020	1	143 1021	1	143 1058	1	143 1058	1	143
