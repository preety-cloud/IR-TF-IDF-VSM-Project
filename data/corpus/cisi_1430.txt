The Universal Decimal Classification and Technical Information Indexing .A Vickery, B.C. This study of the UDC sets out from the assumption that both general and special documentation services can make use of a general classification.  On the other hand, it assumes that the criticisms of the UDC - the preference of some documentalists for alternative special schemes - imply that the UDC does not adequately provide the facilities currently needed.  In examining these criticisms and some special schemes an effort is made here to elucidate those features of the UDC which prevent it from being more widely used and then to suggest how the UDC might be developed to provide the facilities needed. .X 75	1	1430 154	3	1430 257	1	1430 260	1	1430 476	2	1430 477	3	1430 653	2	1430 838	4	1430 898	2	1430 1066	1	1430 1074	2	1430 1075	2	1430 1231	1	1430 1255	1	1430 1259	2	1430 1391	4	1430 1394	1	1430 1402	2	1430 1429	5	1430 1430	5	1430 1430	5	1430
