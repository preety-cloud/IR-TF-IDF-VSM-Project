The Ranking of Biomedical Periodicals from the Indian Scientist's Point of View .A Sengupta, I. N. The output of scientific literature has been increasing exponentially since the second quarter of this century.. New journals in specialized branches of science keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of volumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject areas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for publication.. The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective countries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field of the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist.. This method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries by changing the citing journals according to their country's needs.. .X 33	1	1432 36	1	1432 41	1	1432 76	1	1432 89	2	1432 97	1	1432 102	1	1432 111	1	1432 112	1	1432 163	1	1432 183	2	1432 184	2	1432 193	2	1432 198	1	1432 199	1	1432 201	1	1432 203	1	1432 204	1	1432 210	1	1432 225	1	1432 269	1	1432 360	3	1432 361	1	1432 373	1	1432 543	3	1432 545	1	1432 552	2	1432 587	1	1432 605	1	1432 613	1	1432 614	1	1432 638	1	1432 735	2	1432 747	1	1432 750	1	1432 753	1	1432 759	1	1432 766	2	1432 767	1	1432 775	2	1432 776	1	1432 782	1	1432 784	2	1432 788	1	1432 789	1	1432 793	1	1432 800	1	1432 808	1	1432 828	1	1432 905	1	1432 953	1	1432 977	1	1432 983	1	1432 1016	1	1432 1023	1	1432 1030	1	1432 1055	2	1432 1087	1	1432 1090	1	1432 1135	1	1432 1260	1	1432 1275	3	1432 1276	2	1432 1278	1	1432 1280	1	1432 1285	1	1432 1286	1	1432 1287	1	1432 1302	1	1432 1335	1	1432 1390	1	1432 1397	2	1432 1417	1	1432 1428	1	1432 1432	7	1432 1432	7	1432
