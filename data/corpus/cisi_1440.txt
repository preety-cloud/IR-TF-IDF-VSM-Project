Book Availability and the Library User .A Guyton, T.L. The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library services. .X 234	1	1440 304	1	1440 306	1	1440 338	1	1440 646	1	1440 647	1	1440 651	1	1440 942	1	1440 943	1	1440 944	1	1440 948	1	1440 1017	1	1440 1049	1	1440 1206	1	1440 1237	1	1440 1378	1	1440 1440	8	1440 1450	1	1440 1453	1	1440 1453	1	1440
