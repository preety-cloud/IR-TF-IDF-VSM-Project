Universal Bibliographic Control .A Anderson, D. IFLA will be nearly fifty years old when Dorothy Anderson's UBC paper is published.  It is tempting to say that it is a half a century overdue.  When librarians first began to look beyond their national borders, bibliographic control was in the forefront of their concern.  Gradually, however, these pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social and even economic achievements of the international library community - which was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of national efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others overgenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception. .X 92	1	1441 94	1	1441 121	1	1441 172	1	1441 235	1	1441 246	1	1441 247	1	1441 299	1	1441 326	1	1441 333	1	1441 361	1	1441 365	1	1441 434	1	1441 453	1	1441 530	1	1441 534	1	1441 541	1	1441 639	1	1441 652	1	1441 824	1	1441 825	2	1441 856	1	1441 872	1	1441 873	1	1441 874	1	1441 878	1	1441 880	1	1441 881	1	1441 886	1	1441 888	1	1441 913	1	1441 919	1	1441 920	1	1441 921	1	1441 939	1	1441 940	1	1441 941	1	1441 943	1	1441 947	1	1441 950	1	1441 963	1	1441 991	1	1441 996	1	1441 997	1	1441 1000	1	1441 1004	1	1441 1061	1	1441 1080	1	1441 1146	1	1441 1153	1	1441 1215	1	1441 1216	1	1441 1257	1	1441 1258	1	1441 1266	1	1441 1374	1	1441 1395	1	1441 1433	1	1441 1435	1	1441 1436	1	1441 1437	1	1441 1441	15	1441 1441	15	1441
