The Universal Decimal Classification .A Foskett, A.C. This study represents the result of some fifteen years of contact with the Universal Decimal Classification, as a user, as a reviser and as a classification teacher.  As a Information Officer at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, I was concerned with the use of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), both as classifier and as user of the resulting catalogues; I was also directly concerned as Liaison Officer for the Atomic Energy Research committee for UDC with the development of the Code of Practice which later became the basis of the Special subject edition for nuclear science and engineering.  With accelerators; this work was carried out along the general lines indicated in this study, and is now part of UDC, which indicates that modern ideas can be accommodated within the scheme without undue strain. .X 141	1	1442 299	2	1442 333	2	1442 522	1	1442 530	1	1442 627	2	1442 628	2	1442 873	1	1442 874	2	1442 875	2	1442 876	1	1442 892	2	1442 941	2	1442 994	1	1442 995	2	1442 996	1	1442 997	1	1442 998	1	1442 1075	1	1442 1079	2	1442 1153	1	1442 1189	1	1442 1251	1	1442 1351	2	1442 1396	1	1442 1420	2	1442 1434	2	1442 1435	2	1442 1442	8	1442 1448	1	1442 1448	1	1442
