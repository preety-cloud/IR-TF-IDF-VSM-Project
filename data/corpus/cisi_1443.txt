Universals in Linguistic Theory .A Fillmore, C.J. We feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinking in the last decade.  It is not longer of any interest to describe one after another language 'anyhow' without regard to the relevance of the facts to general linguistic theory.  As Ross put it, it makes no sense to talk about 'describing a language in terms of its own structure alone.'  Toward the end of the conference, when it had become apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently explicitly formulated model, the question was raised:  What should we be teaching our students?  Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt: We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic problem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light - negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in general are like. .X 77	1	1443 79	1	1443 117	1	1443 168	4	1443 175	1	1443 317	2	1443 320	3	1443 488	1	1443 489	1	1443 493	1	1443 498	1	1443 499	2	1443 558	1	1443 570	1	1443 572	2	1443 581	1	1443 590	2	1443 659	1	1443 664	1	1443 790	1	1443 819	1	1443 1024	1	1443 1027	1	1443 1045	1	1443 1046	3	1443 1047	1	1443 1118	1	1443 1213	1	1443 1215	1	1443 1231	1	1443 1294	1	1443 1389	1	1443 1399	1	1443 1443	6	1443 1443	6	1443
