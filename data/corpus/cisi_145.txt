ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services .A Williams, M.E. The data in that survey covered the year 1971.  Many recipients of the 1972 document have requested updated information.  Accordingly, the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey. The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responses came in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all member organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI. Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in 1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source for information as to which centers are processing which data bases. Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and 41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75 that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base processing organizations.  The use of online search services was relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be representative of the 1976 online situation. .X 10	1	145 18	5	145 121	1	145 125	2	145 127	4	145 129	2	145 145	10	145 211	2	145 357	1	145 376	3	145 378	1	145 382	1	145 400	1	145 440	1	145 452	2	145 453	1	145 459	3	145 467	1	145 468	1	145 495	1	145 506	1	145 508	1	145 511	1	145 512	1	145 514	1	145 517	1	145 520	1	145 521	1	145 523	1	145 524	2	145 525	1	145 526	1	145 527	1	145 528	1	145 529	1	145 530	1	145 534	1	145 546	1	145 576	1	145 580	1	145 594	1	145 604	1	145 609	1	145 612	1	145 619	1	145 622	1	145 623	1	145 629	1	145 631	1	145 632	1	145 633	2	145 635	1	145 636	1	145 637	1	145 642	1	145 699	1	145 700	1	145 702	1	145 703	1	145 705	1	145 707	1	145 723	1	145 726	1	145 727	1	145 728	1	145 729	1	145 730	3	145 731	1	145 732	1	145 733	1	145 734	1	145 736	1	145 754	1	145 812	1	145 813	1	145 814	1	145 820	1	145 822	1	145 826	1	145 827	1	145 866	1	145 870	1	145 873	1	145 877	1	145 879	1	145 942	1	145 1051	1	145 1078	1	145 1089	1	145 1091	1	145 1143	3	145 1227	1	145 1264	1	145 1302	2	145 1303	2	145 1366	1	145 1367	1	145 1368	2	145 1370	1	145 1372	1	145 1383	1	145 1390	1	145 1396	5	145 1396	5	145
