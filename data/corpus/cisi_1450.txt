Weeding Library Collections .A Slote, S.J. This book is based upon two recent research projects in weeding and identifying core collections.  However, it became apparent that the principles and techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library collections. This work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes: 1. As a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion, knowledge, and serious research in the field of weeding.  The author's own research is reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  In addition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study. 2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their present collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain and justify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for "weeding without tears." 3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal with the acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one of the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful collections. 4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped that libraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs of weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of circulation and in user satisfaction. .X 46	1	1450 115	1	1450 234	1	1450 304	1	1450 306	1	1450 338	1	1450 646	1	1450 647	1	1450 651	1	1450 942	1	1450 943	2	1450 944	1	1450 948	1	1450 983	1	1450 1017	1	1450 1021	1	1450 1023	1	1450 1049	1	1450 1203	1	1450 1206	1	1450 1237	1	1450 1378	1	1450 1417	1	1450 1440	1	1450 1450	9	1450 1453	1	1450 1453	1	1450
