Some Behavioral Patterns of Library Users:  The 80/20 rule .A Trueswell, R.L. A characteristic of inventory in business or industry is that approximately 80 percent of the number of transactions taken from a warehouse represents about 20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also be considered as a ranking of stock items by their transaction activity which will show that the top 20 percent of the stocked items (i.e., the most active items) account for about 80 percent of the total number of transactions.  The rule is sometimes expressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation. It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100 as the phenomena relate to the relationships between the two statistical measures. .X 2	1	1451 24	1	1451 31	1	1451 74	1	1451 75	1	1451 76	1	1451 111	1	1451 119	1	1451 122	1	1451 132	1	1451 137	1	1451 139	1	1451 152	1	1451 155	1	1451 183	2	1451 193	1	1451 195	1	1451 201	1	1451 203	1	1451 204	1	1451 210	1	1451 269	1	1451 336	1	1451 475	1	1451 552	1	1451 684	1	1451 760	1	1451 767	1	1451 774	1	1451 775	1	1451 778	1	1451 788	2	1451 789	2	1451 955	1	1451 961	1	1451 977	2	1451 1011	1	1451 1055	1	1451 1056	1	1451 1203	1	1451 1275	1	1451 1352	1	1451 1451	6	1451 1451	6	1451
