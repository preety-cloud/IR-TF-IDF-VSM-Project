World Trends in Library Education .A Bramley, G. One of the most significant aspects of the evolution of librarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence of the library schools as a potent factor in shaping new philosophies and new attitudes in the library profession.  The intention of the present work is to examine some of the implications of this rapid growth in the number of library schools, noting current trends and possible changes in the future.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed, and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo- American library education, while at the same time examining other major patterns of professional education for librarians which exist in the world, and comparing these with the approach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt has been made to trace the influences which the British and America systems of library education have had, particularly in the developing countries. .X 128	1	1457 130	1	1457 191	1	1457 339	1	1457 370	1	1457 376	1	1457 387	1	1457 453	1	1457 629	1	1457 648	1	1457 652	1	1457 1376	1	1457 1403	1	1457 1457	5	1457 1457	5	1457
