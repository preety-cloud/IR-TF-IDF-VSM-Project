Research on Users' Needs: Where is it Getting Us? .A Hanson, C.W. Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering habits, and the use to which they put information. Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been based upon observations and records of what the scientists and engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions, and collections of facts. .X 41	1	147 132	1	147 147	8	147 157	1	147 161	1	147 210	1	147 245	1	147 355	1	147 356	1	147 560	1	147 614	1	147 763	1	147 772	1	147 788	1	147 792	1	147 889	1	147 965	1	147 986	1	147 1050	1	147 1151	1	147 1238	1	147 1254	1	147 1291	1	147 1404	2	147 1404	2	147
