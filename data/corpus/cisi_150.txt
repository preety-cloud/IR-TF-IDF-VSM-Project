Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA .A Abbot, M.T.J. Hunter, P.S. Simkins, M.A. During the past year we have been one of the organizations participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical- Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type. .X 38	2	150 40	1	150 52	2	150 53	1	150 54	1	150 150	9	150 319	1	150 347	1	150 371	1	150 429	1	150 465	2	150 480	1	150 510	2	150 582	2	150 589	4	150 603	3	150 660	2	150 662	1	150 681	1	150 682	1	150 704	1	150 711	1	150 714	1	150 716	1	150 717	1	150 722	2	150 726	1	150 782	1	150 807	1	150 810	1	150 813	1	150 820	1	150 830	1	150 1089	1	150 1144	1	150 1151	1	150 1195	3	150 1281	1	150 1421	1	150 1448	1	150 1448	1	150
