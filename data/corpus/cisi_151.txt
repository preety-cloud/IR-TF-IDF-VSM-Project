Thesaurus Compilation Methods:  A Literature Review .A Blagden, J.F. This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information and the end product of the complete research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus. A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent). Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest. .X 148	1	151 151	6	151 454	1	151 477	1	151 501	2	151 504	3	151 653	1	151 773	1	151 781	1	151 798	2	151 802	1	151 1118	2	151 1122	1	151 1123	1	151 1133	1	151 1141	1	151 1163	1	151 1175	1	151 1226	1	151 1226	1	151
