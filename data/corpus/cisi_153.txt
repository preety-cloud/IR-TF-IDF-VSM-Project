Criteria for Evaluating Technical Library Effectiveness .A Wessel, C.J. In July 1966 John I. Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three phases aimed at: I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating libraries developed up to the present. II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already published, or from any other sources, by which to develop criteria. III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria. Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present some of the findings of the study. .X 14	1	153 71	1	153 72	1	153 73	1	153 74	1	153 75	1	153 77	1	153 78	1	153 79	1	153 81	1	153 82	1	153 83	2	153 86	1	153 153	6	153 156	1	153 170	1	153 206	1	153 207	1	153 211	1	153 212	1	153 223	1	153 245	2	153 266	1	153 271	1	153 277	1	153 279	1	153 280	1	153 458	1	153 486	1	153 550	1	153 591	1	153 720	1	153 748	1	153 779	2	153 785	1	153 786	1	153 787	1	153 788	1	153 789	1	153 791	1	153 792	1	153 841	1	153 842	1	153 925	1	153 984	1	153 1019	1	153 1028	1	153 1086	1	153 1090	1	153 1317	2	153 1424	1	153 1424	1	153
