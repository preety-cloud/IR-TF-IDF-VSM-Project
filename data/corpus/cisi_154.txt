The UDC in its International Aspects .A Lloyd, G.A. Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or some such title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there will hardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the half-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able to convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of users throughout the world. .X 16	1	154 30	1	154 71	1	154 75	2	154 77	1	154 78	1	154 79	1	154 80	1	154 81	1	154 82	1	154 83	1	154 114	1	154 154	6	154 194	1	154 212	2	154 247	1	154 257	1	154 260	1	154 458	1	154 476	1	154 477	1	154 581	1	154 627	1	154 666	1	154 770	1	154 796	2	154 802	2	154 838	4	154 853	1	154 898	1	154 989	1	154 1066	1	154 1074	2	154 1075	2	154 1231	1	154 1255	1	154 1391	2	154 1392	1	154 1393	1	154 1394	1	154 1402	2	154 1429	3	154 1430	3	154 1431	3	154 1448	1	154 1448	1	154
