Subject Relations in Science/Technology Literature .A Earle, P. Vickery, B. The analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use of the literature of science and technology.  Citation is only an indicator of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects. Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere. Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/ technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science literature, and this has been reported elsewhere. .X 2	1	155 33	2	155 76	1	155 89	1	155 105	1	155 107	1	155 110	1	155 111	1	155 132	1	155 137	1	155 139	1	155 152	1	155 155	6	155 157	1	155 161	1	155 183	1	155 195	1	155 203	1	155 204	1	155 210	1	155 314	1	155 356	1	155 475	1	155 544	1	155 552	1	155 560	1	155 582	1	155 587	1	155 618	1	155 656	1	155 685	1	155 760	1	155 774	1	155 775	2	155 788	2	155 789	1	155 793	1	155 794	1	155 800	1	155 808	1	155 977	1	155 1030	1	155 1050	1	155 1055	1	155 1056	1	155 1062	1	155 1256	1	155 1273	1	155 1284	1	155 1285	2	155 1287	1	155 1290	1	155 1291	1	155 1293	1	155 1294	1	155 1295	1	155 1296	1	155 1297	1	155 1308	1	155 1319	1	155 1338	1	155 1346	1	155 1386	1	155 1451	1	155 1451	1	155
