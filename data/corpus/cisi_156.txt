Letter to the Editor:  Assessment of Information Services .A Davison, P.s. May we please raise four questions which are important at the present time when government policy on information retrieval is being considered? These arise from results recently produced by SDC which are germane to Dr. Somerfield's paper on 'Computer-based Information Services' (Aslib Proceedings, 20, 12, 542-50 (1968)), and to OSTI's work in this field. The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This results from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearly two hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry' were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary. .X 65	1	156 71	1	156 72	1	156 73	1	156 74	1	156 75	2	156 76	1	156 77	1	156 78	1	156 79	1	156 81	1	156 82	1	156 83	1	156 86	2	156 153	1	156 156	5	156 211	1	156 212	1	156 213	1	156 214	1	156 245	1	156 277	1	156 279	1	156 280	1	156 382	1	156 486	1	156 495	1	156 720	1	156 748	1	156 779	1	156 785	1	156 786	1	156 787	1	156 788	1	156 789	1	156 790	1	156 791	1	156 925	1	156 984	1	156 1055	1	156 1083	1	156 1086	1	156 1195	1	156 1295	1	156 1297	1	156 1297	1	156
