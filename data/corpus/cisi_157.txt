On the Design of Information Systems for Human Beings .A Line, M.B. Planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem which has to be solved - for example, an increasing number of people may have to be housed in the same area; or by a long-term idealistic vision; or by both (the idealist seeing the long-term implications of an immediate problem).  In short-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may be solved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to take my housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without considering the possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-term planning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced. .X 28	1	157 89	1	157 105	1	157 110	1	157 147	1	157 155	1	157 157	7	157 314	1	157 356	1	157 381	1	157 389	1	157 468	1	157 475	1	157 514	1	157 518	1	157 544	1	157 560	1	157 582	1	157 595	1	157 615	1	157 646	1	157 656	2	157 658	1	157 685	1	157 752	1	157 785	1	157 820	1	157 822	1	157 827	1	157 829	1	157 895	1	157 1030	1	157 1050	1	157 1062	1	157 1091	1	157 1256	1	157 1282	1	157 1284	1	157 1285	1	157 1290	1	157 1291	1	157 1293	1	157 1294	1	157 1295	1	157 1296	1	157 1297	1	157 1319	1	157 1346	1	157 1361	1	157 1386	1	157 1386	1	157
