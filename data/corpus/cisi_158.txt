Standard Costing for Information Systems: Background to a Current Study .A Robertson, S.E. Reynolds, R. Wilkin, A.P. For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information systems.  A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R. Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject: such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems. One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting them. In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in this project follows. .X 2	1	158 5	1	158 27	1	158 74	1	158 83	1	158 90	1	158 91	1	158 152	1	158 158	8	158 222	1	158 223	1	158 249	1	158 292	1	158 368	1	158 435	1	158 490	1	158 491	1	158 492	1	158 495	1	158 496	1	158 497	1	158 500	1	158 584	1	158 591	1	158 615	1	158 770	1	158 776	1	158 815	2	158 823	1	158 841	3	158 842	1	158 925	1	158 948	1	158 957	1	158 1023	1	158 1219	1	158 1227	1	158 1242	1	158 1317	1	158 1365	1	158 1390	1	158 1401	1	158 1414	1	158 1414	1	158
