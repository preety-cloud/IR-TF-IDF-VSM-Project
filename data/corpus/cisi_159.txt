An Information Retrieval Language for MARC .A Austin, D. I see from the programme that I am supposed to talk on an information language for MARC, and it is true that the work I have been doing for the past year or so has been under the auspices of the MARC Project.  But the subject indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB's plans for computer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope to show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible general system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, it is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which caused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing. .X 159	5	159 178	1	159 257	1	159 260	1	159 348	1	159 429	1	159 489	1	159 493	1	159 498	1	159 501	1	159 582	1	159 583	2	159 585	1	159 653	1	159 655	2	159 688	1	159 796	1	159 797	2	159 798	2	159 799	1	159 801	1	159 802	1	159 838	1	159 852	1	159 854	1	159 857	1	159 858	2	159 859	2	159 861	2	159 970	1	159 1043	1	159 1252	1	159 1268	1	159 1395	1	159 1405	1	159 1405	1	159
