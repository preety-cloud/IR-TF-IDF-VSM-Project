Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval .A Farradane, J.E.L. In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or 'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so much difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today. .X 72	1	160 160	6	160 168	1	160 257	1	160 258	1	160 477	1	160 478	2	160 516	3	160 558	2	160 572	1	160 600	1	160 628	1	160 653	1	160 746	2	160 758	1	160 781	1	160 795	1	160 817	1	160 825	1	160 901	1	160 1202	1	160 1215	1	160 1218	1	160 1230	1	160 1394	1	160 1422	1	160 1448	1	160 1448	1	160
