The Information Uses and Needs of Social Scientists: An Overview of INFROSS .A Line, M.B. When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information, very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand, we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable studies.  There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field. .X 4	1	163 9	1	163 32	1	163 33	1	163 36	1	163 41	1	163 89	1	163 96	1	163 97	1	163 102	1	163 105	1	163 111	2	163 112	1	163 113	1	163 137	1	163 161	2	163 163	6	163 183	1	163 184	1	163 193	1	163 199	1	163 203	1	163 207	1	163 210	1	163 225	1	163 243	1	163 269	1	163 311	1	163 356	1	163 373	1	163 386	1	163 398	1	163 456	1	163 545	2	163 552	1	163 560	2	163 587	1	163 592	1	163 602	1	163 605	1	163 607	1	163 613	1	163 614	1	163 638	1	163 735	1	163 747	1	163 750	1	163 753	1	163 766	1	163 767	1	163 768	1	163 774	1	163 775	1	163 782	1	163 783	1	163 784	1	163 788	1	163 789	1	163 793	1	163 799	1	163 800	1	163 808	1	163 811	1	163 816	1	163 905	1	163 913	1	163 953	1	163 961	1	163 962	1	163 964	1	163 968	1	163 977	1	163 983	1	163 1016	1	163 1023	1	163 1030	2	163 1055	1	163 1068	1	163 1087	1	163 1090	1	163 1135	1	163 1203	1	163 1260	1	163 1270	1	163 1275	1	163 1276	1	163 1278	1	163 1280	1	163 1285	1	163 1286	1	163 1287	1	163 1293	1	163 1296	1	163 1298	1	163 1302	1	163 1321	1	163 1335	1	163 1346	1	163 1347	1	163 1390	1	163 1397	1	163 1407	1	163 1417	1	163 1428	1	163 1432	1	163 1445	1	163 1445	1	163
