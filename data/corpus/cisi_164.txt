SDI:  Some Economic and Organizational Aspects .A Dammers, H.F. In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that I should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) operation and use.  In my opinion the technical feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the main barriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature. At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In addition to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes (prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and, on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia. All these tapes are searched locally, involving the running of around five hundred profiles weekly. .X 18	1	164 34	1	164 49	1	164 53	1	164 59	2	164 164	6	164 172	1	164 178	1	164 202	1	164 213	1	164 224	2	164 243	1	164 274	1	164 374	1	164 401	1	164 419	1	164 421	1	164 465	1	164 466	1	164 467	2	164 481	1	164 490	2	164 491	3	164 506	2	164 507	2	164 510	1	164 512	2	164 520	1	164 523	1	164 591	2	164 595	1	164 603	1	164 604	1	164 609	2	164 622	1	164 623	2	164 629	1	164 633	1	164 639	1	164 659	1	164 676	1	164 687	1	164 711	1	164 714	1	164 722	1	164 723	1	164 726	1	164 728	1	164 730	1	164 731	1	164 732	1	164 809	2	164 810	1	164 813	2	164 814	2	164 820	1	164 822	2	164 828	1	164 870	1	164 879	1	164 907	1	164 1084	1	164 1089	1	164 1091	1	164 1283	1	164 1298	3	164 1299	1	164 1363	1	164 1366	1	164 1367	1	164 1368	1	164 1396	2	164 1396	2	164
