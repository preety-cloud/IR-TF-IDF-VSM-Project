The Theoretical Foundation of the IDC-system: Six Postulates for Information Retrieval .A Fugmann, Robert Successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable. By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of an inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher. The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience with the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basis of this system and of its further development. .X 29	1	165 58	1	165 117	1	165 124	1	165 125	1	165 165	7	165 252	1	165 254	1	165 347	1	165 381	1	165 445	2	165 448	1	165 451	1	165 452	1	165 476	1	165 484	1	165 511	1	165 516	1	165 518	1	165 521	1	165 522	1	165 523	1	165 525	2	165 526	1	165 527	1	165 528	1	165 529	1	165 530	1	165 575	1	165 590	2	165 609	1	165 610	1	165 615	1	165 621	3	165 625	1	165 626	1	165 636	1	165 641	3	165 656	1	165 668	1	165 670	1	165 671	2	165 673	1	165 674	1	165 683	2	165 687	1	165 689	3	165 700	1	165 705	1	165 707	1	165 714	1	165 715	1	165 727	1	165 754	1	165 762	1	165 797	1	165 812	1	165 814	1	165 817	1	165 819	1	165 824	1	165 875	1	165 898	1	165 901	1	165 1077	3	165 1089	1	165 1231	4	165 1303	1	165 1327	1	165 1364	1	165 1366	1	165 1367	1	165 1368	1	165 1404	1	165 1452	1	165 1452	1	165
