Aspects of the Theory of Syntax .A Chomsky, N. The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by no means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836).  His view that a language "makes infinite use of finite means" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this "creative" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a "generative grammar," in essentially the contemporary sense of this term. This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions. .X 21	1	168 51	1	168 69	2	168 71	1	168 77	2	168 79	2	168 118	1	168 160	1	168 168	17	168 174	1	168 175	2	168 176	1	168 258	1	168 315	1	168 317	5	168 320	2	168 324	2	168 332	1	168 382	1	168 388	1	168 399	1	168 417	1	168 443	1	168 448	1	168 479	1	168 480	1	168 483	1	168 484	1	168 486	1	168 488	2	168 489	1	168 491	1	168 493	2	168 498	1	168 499	1	168 503	1	168 507	1	168 509	1	168 510	1	168 512	1	168 517	1	168 520	1	168 522	1	168 527	1	168 528	1	168 531	1	168 546	1	168 558	2	168 565	1	168 566	2	168 570	1	168 572	3	168 581	2	168 590	1	168 596	1	168 603	1	168 608	2	168 633	1	168 659	2	168 715	1	168 746	1	168 754	1	168 790	2	168 805	1	168 809	1	168 810	1	168 812	1	168 813	1	168 814	1	168 817	2	168 819	1	168 824	1	168 825	2	168 894	1	168 902	2	168 1024	1	168 1027	1	168 1045	1	168 1046	3	168 1047	1	168 1051	1	168 1118	1	168 1144	1	168 1213	1	168 1215	2	168 1225	1	168 1230	1	168 1231	1	168 1294	2	168 1310	1	168 1327	2	168 1386	1	168 1388	1	168 1389	1	168 1399	5	168 1413	1	168 1419	1	168 1427	1	168 1443	4	168 1448	1	168 1448	1	168
