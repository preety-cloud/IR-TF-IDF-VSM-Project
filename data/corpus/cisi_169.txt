The Assault on Privacy .A Miller, A.R. The genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call I received during the fall of 1966 from Dr. James G. Miller, then Director of the University of Michigan's Mental Health Institute and currently Vice President for Academic Affairs of Cleveland State University.  He asked what I am sure he thought was a relatively straightforward and easily answered question:  What are the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials? On closer inquiry I discovered that Dr. Miller was exploring the possibility of using computer technology to develop a national, multi-media information network, that would electronically integrate our colleges and universities, eventually providing each of them a comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works and educational services.  He subsequently sought to breathe life into this idea of promoting the formation of an organization called the Interuniversity Communications Council (EDUCOM). .X 114	1	169 169	8	169 289	1	169 345	1	169 400	1	169 401	1	169 459	1	169 493	1	169 548	1	169 627	1	169 990	1	169 1073	1	169 1077	1	169 1148	1	169 1227	1	169 1368	1	169 1392	1	169 1414	1	169 1448	1	169 1448	1	169
