An Assessment of Quality in Graduate Education .A Cartter, A.M. Before this study was begun in the spring of 1964, serious deliberation was given to the question of American Council of Education sponsorship of an evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities that comprise an important segment of the Council's membership.  There was never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective way what necessarily goes on continually in any event, though usually in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way.  Our Commission on Plans and Objectives for Higher Education, and other leading educators consulted, concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the Council's aegis was a suitable one. .X 14	1	170 48	1	170 97	1	170 99	1	170 102	2	170 103	1	170 104	2	170 106	1	170 108	1	170 110	1	170 111	1	170 112	1	170 113	1	170 153	1	170 170	8	170 223	1	170 266	2	170 271	1	170 456	1	170 545	1	170 550	1	170 560	1	170 793	1	170 893	1	170 1019	1	170 1028	1	170 1062	1	170 1086	1	170 1087	1	170 1090	1	170 1283	1	170 1285	1	170 1287	2	170 1291	1	170 1320	1	170 1334	1	170 1337	1	170 1340	1	170 1342	1	170 1343	1	170 1344	1	170 1346	1	170 1347	2	170 1424	1	170 1424	1	170
