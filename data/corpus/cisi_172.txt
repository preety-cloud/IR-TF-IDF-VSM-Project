As We May Think .A Bush, V. As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare.  In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor .X 3	1	172 20	1	172 42	1	172 58	1	172 60	1	172 62	1	172 85	1	172 120	1	172 129	1	172 164	1	172 172	14	172 178	1	172 191	1	172 194	1	172 211	1	172 212	1	172 214	1	172 216	1	172 217	1	172 218	1	172 220	1	172 274	1	172 283	1	172 293	1	172 296	1	172 360	2	172 365	1	172 374	1	172 386	1	172 417	1	172 419	1	172 421	1	172 446	1	172 453	1	172 458	1	172 469	1	172 481	1	172 482	1	172 485	1	172 491	1	172 497	1	172 507	1	172 520	1	172 523	1	172 572	1	172 577	1	172 578	2	172 579	1	172 585	1	172 599	1	172 615	1	172 623	1	172 640	2	172 652	2	172 665	1	172 762	1	172 803	1	172 822	1	172 825	1	172 856	1	172 886	1	172 888	1	172 891	1	172 902	1	172 907	5	172 913	1	172 943	1	172 963	1	172 967	1	172 1004	1	172 1022	1	172 1030	1	172 1033	1	172 1045	1	172 1084	1	172 1147	1	172 1150	1	172 1207	1	172 1219	2	172 1257	1	172 1258	1	172 1268	4	172 1279	1	172 1387	1	172 1402	1	172 1417	1	172 1418	1	172 1426	3	172 1433	1	172 1441	1	172 1441	1	172
