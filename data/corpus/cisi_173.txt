Authoritarian Personality .A Adorno, T.W. This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is not simply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body of information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively new concept - the rise of an "anthropological" species we call the authoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others, jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power and authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and political thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means of socio-psychological research. .X 173	6	173 227	1	173 237	2	173 387	1	173 418	1	173 1070	1	173 1150	1	173 1186	1	173 1187	1	173 1240	1	173 1340	1	173 1340	1	173
