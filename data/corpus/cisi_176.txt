Automated Keyword Classification for Information Retrieval .A Sparck-Jones, K. This book is primarily a research monograph, in which the discussion of the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to their surrounding context in information retrieval as a whole; it is not a textbook, and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choice of topic, or account for the use of certain concepts, or to provide an elementary description of either.  For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information retrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the use of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally, in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument; but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this, or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios. .X 26	1	176 30	1	176 51	3	176 57	2	176 61	1	176 69	1	176 71	2	176 73	1	176 75	1	176 77	2	176 79	1	176 114	1	176 144	1	176 168	1	176 175	6	176 176	16	176 315	1	176 327	1	176 329	1	176 363	1	176 382	1	176 419	3	176 434	1	176 446	1	176 448	2	176 458	2	176 480	1	176 483	2	176 484	1	176 486	1	176 488	3	176 491	1	176 493	1	176 499	1	176 500	1	176 503	1	176 507	1	176 509	4	176 510	1	176 512	1	176 517	2	176 520	1	176 522	2	176 527	2	176 528	1	176 531	1	176 565	5	176 566	2	176 570	1	176 572	1	176 576	1	176 577	2	176 581	1	176 595	1	176 596	4	176 603	1	176 608	2	176 619	1	176 633	1	176 644	1	176 659	2	176 660	2	176 661	1	176 662	2	176 664	1	176 715	1	176 754	1	176 785	1	176 790	1	176 805	1	176 809	1	176 810	2	176 812	3	176 813	2	176 814	2	176 817	1	176 824	2	176 825	1	176 830	1	176 870	1	176 894	2	176 928	1	176 963	1	176 990	1	176 991	1	176 1044	1	176 1051	1	176 1218	1	176 1255	1	176 1294	1	176 1307	1	176 1327	2	176 1413	1	176 1414	1	176 1419	1	176 1427	1	176 1445	1	176 1448	1	176 1448	1	176
