Automation in Libraries .A Kimber, R.T. My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding of what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limited myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed "library housekeeping" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing, periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is to make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, and disseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processes which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of service which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that the descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries. .X 24	1	177 75	1	177 78	1	177 80	1	177 177	7	177 281	1	177 287	1	177 336	1	177 348	1	177 374	1	177 406	1	177 408	2	177 458	1	177 471	1	177 849	1	177 852	1	177 853	1	177 854	1	177 855	1	177 897	1	177 916	1	177 979	1	177 984	1	177 1007	1	177 1011	1	177 1248	1	177 1327	1	177 1433	1	177 1433	1	177
