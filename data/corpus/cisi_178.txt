The Automation Survey: Background and Conclusions .A King, G.W. During the past decade the Library of Congress, in common with many other research libraries, has become increasingly aware of pressures and strains in many of its operations.  These areas of concern (well known to librarians) include mounting arrearages in cataloguing and other processing activities; increasing complexity of manual inventory control files; increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues reasonably current and accurate; and increasing demands for a wide variety of services for a clientele whose needs for information have grown tremendously since World War II, and many of whom have only recently turned to large research libraries for help.  Five years ago an internal committee of the Library of Congress was charged to study potential applications of electronic data processing equipment to Library procedures; subsequently representatives of three computer firms made brief studies of Library operations which intimated that certain areas could benefit substantially by automation. .X 159	1	178 164	1	178 172	1	178 178	11	178 206	1	178 245	2	178 249	1	178 287	1	178 291	1	178 374	1	178 406	1	178 408	3	178 419	1	178 481	1	178 491	1	178 507	1	178 520	1	178 523	1	178 591	1	178 623	1	178 822	1	178 852	1	178 854	1	178 857	1	178 858	1	178 859	1	178 861	1	178 907	2	178 916	1	178 925	1	178 959	1	178 960	1	178 962	2	178 970	1	178 976	1	178 997	1	178 1007	2	178 1011	1	178 1033	1	178 1043	1	178 1071	1	178 1252	2	178 1317	1	178 1358	1	178 1371	1	178 1400	3	178 1400	3	178
