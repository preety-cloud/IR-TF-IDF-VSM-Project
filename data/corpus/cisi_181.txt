Medical School Library Statistics .A Keenan, E.L. At the June 1962 Convention of the Medical Library Association in Chicago, Illinois, Mr. Stanley Truelson, now Librarian of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, circulated a petition requesting the collection and publication of medical school library statistics.  Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed the petition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group of the Medical Library Association. This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself, studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Office of Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of our specialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminology in the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitions for Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961). After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by the committee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the United States and Canada.  The Canadian medical school libraries were included as a result of communications with Miss Doreen Fraser, Librarian of the Bio-Medical Library of the University of British Columbia and Dr. J. Wendell McLeod of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges. .X 31	1	181 36	1	181 41	1	181 46	1	181 181	5	181 182	2	181 183	2	181 184	2	181 193	1	181 195	1	181 198	1	181 201	2	181 203	1	181 204	1	181 205	1	181 206	1	181 207	2	181 208	2	181 217	1	181 269	1	181 395	1	181 415	1	181 748	1	181 760	1	181 767	1	181 774	1	181 778	1	181 891	3	181 905	1	181 952	1	181 953	1	181 964	1	181 968	1	181 1009	1	181 1018	1	181 1019	1	181 1240	1	181 1359	1	181 1397	1	181 1417	1	181 1417	1	181
