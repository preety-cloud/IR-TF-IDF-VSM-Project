The Contemporary Medical Society Library .A Crawford, Susan Michel, Carol Waligorski, Conrad Four hundred sixty-eight medical societies  in the United States were surveyed to determine those which sponsor libraries.. Seventy-eight libraries were identified, of which eighteen are "marginal" and nine are jointly supported by a medical school and a society, leaving fifty-one relatively "substantial" libraries whose major support is through society membership.. Characteristics measured include size of collection, types of media, staff, budget, services, and sources of support.. Questions are raised concerning the role of the medical library as one institution which participates in the continuing education of the physician.. .X 31	1	182 36	1	182 41	1	182 46	1	182 181	2	182 182	5	182 183	2	182 184	2	182 185	2	182 186	1	182 193	1	182 195	1	182 198	1	182 201	2	182 203	1	182 204	1	182 205	1	182 220	1	182 269	1	182 395	1	182 415	1	182 760	1	182 767	1	182 774	1	182 778	1	182 891	3	182 905	1	182 952	1	182 953	1	182 964	1	182 968	1	182 1009	1	182 1018	1	182 1019	1	182 1240	1	182 1359	1	182 1397	1	182 1417	1	182 1417	1	182
