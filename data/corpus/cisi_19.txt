Adventures in Theory of Languages .A Herdan, G. In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole: quantitative linguistics. The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's "Language as choice and Chance", 1956, has now taken definite shape. Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book, "Language as Choice and Chance", the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample. .X 19	7	19 37	1	19 39	1	19 40	1	19 44	1	19 47	1	19 88	1	19 97	1	19 102	1	19 103	1	19 228	2	19 229	1	19 233	1	19 253	1	19 313	1	19 318	1	19 321	2	19 324	1	19 329	2	19 359	1	19 377	1	19 379	1	19 395	1	19 416	2	19 441	1	19 442	1	19 450	1	19 495	1	19 505	1	19 511	1	19 521	1	19 524	1	19 560	1	19 563	1	19 565	1	19 567	1	19 573	1	19 592	1	19 618	1	19 632	1	19 635	1	19 667	1	19 700	1	19 748	1	19 749	1	19 751	1	19 764	1	19 765	1	19 777	1	19 778	1	19 782	1	19 791	1	19 804	1	19 805	1	19 835	1	19 851	1	19 862	1	19 875	1	19 893	1	19 952	1	19 1016	1	19 1061	1	19 1085	1	19 1086	1	19 1087	1	19 1182	1	19 1194	1	19 1199	2	19 1200	1	19 1274	1	19 1277	1	19 1278	1	19 1280	1	19 1287	1	19 1301	1	19 1302	1	19 1304	1	19 1313	1	19 1338	1	19 1344	1	19 1347	1	19 1380	1	19 1428	1	19 1444	1	19 1444	1	19
