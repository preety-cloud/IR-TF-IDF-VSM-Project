The Evaluation of Published Indexes and Abstract Journals: Criteria and Possible Procedures .A Lancaster, F.W. This paper describes possible criteria by which the effectiveness of a published index  may be evaluated and suggest procedures that might be used to conduct an evaluation of a published index.. The procedures were developed for the National Library of Medicine and relate specifically to the recurring bibliographies produced by MEDLARS in various specialized areas of biomedicine.. The methods described should, however, be applicable to other printed indexes and abstract journals.. Factors affecting the performance  of a published index are also discussed and some research projects relevant to the evaluation of published indexes are reviewed.. .X 86	1	194 114	1	194 154	1	194 172	1	194 191	1	194 194	8	194 212	2	194 274	1	194 401	1	194 417	1	194 446	1	194 458	2	194 480	1	194 485	1	194 572	1	194 577	1	194 579	1	194 615	1	194 627	1	194 640	1	194 752	1	194 770	1	194 781	1	194 785	1	194 796	1	194 802	1	194 817	1	194 825	1	194 902	1	194 959	1	194 1024	1	194 1033	1	194 1054	1	194 1084	1	194 1215	1	194 1279	1	194 1387	1	194 1392	1	194 1431	1	194 1448	1	194 1448	1	194
