AIM-TWX service at the University of Virginia: A Review and Evaluation .A Moll, Wilhelm The paper reviews the highlights of a four-week trial period (November 19 - December 18, 1970) during which the Medical Library of the University of Virginia experimented with a new remote-access bibliographical control and retrieval system via its TWX machine.. The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle "language" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with great rapidity.. .X 66	1	197 120	1	197 124	1	197 127	1	197 129	1	197 161	1	197 190	1	197 191	1	197 197	5	197 211	1	197 214	1	197 218	2	197 243	1	197 307	1	197 330	1	197 332	1	197 375	1	197 378	1	197 382	1	197 445	1	197 450	1	197 451	1	197 452	1	197 454	1	197 459	1	197 468	1	197 472	1	197 484	1	197 492	1	197 503	1	197 506	2	197 507	1	197 508	1	197 511	1	197 512	1	197 514	1	197 518	1	197 520	1	197 523	1	197 524	1	197 525	1	197 526	1	197 529	1	197 530	1	197 534	1	197 546	2	197 553	1	197 554	1	197 579	2	197 591	1	197 593	2	197 594	3	197 595	1	197 596	1	197 597	1	197 599	1	197 600	1	197 603	2	197 604	2	197 606	3	197 609	1	197 610	1	197 611	1	197 612	1	197 625	1	197 626	1	197 630	1	197 634	1	197 636	1	197 637	1	197 642	1	197 648	1	197 650	1	197 692	1	197 696	2	197 699	1	197 703	1	197 705	2	197 708	1	197 723	1	197 724	1	197 726	1	197 727	1	197 728	1	197 731	1	197 732	1	197 733	1	197 734	1	197 736	2	197 738	1	197 739	1	197 740	1	197 741	1	197 742	1	197 743	1	197 744	1	197 755	1	197 795	1	197 801	1	197 805	1	197 806	1	197 820	1	197 826	2	197 827	1	197 836	1	197 866	1	197 867	1	197 879	1	197 883	1	197 956	1	197 989	1	197 1004	1	197 1035	2	197 1078	1	197 1089	1	197 1091	1	197 1207	1	197 1264	1	197 1297	1	197 1298	1	197 1299	1	197 1303	1	197 1327	1	197 1356	1	197 1364	1	197 1368	1	197 1370	1	197 1372	1	197 1373	1	197 1374	1	197 1375	1	197 1376	1	197 1377	1	197 1405	1	197 1405	1	197
