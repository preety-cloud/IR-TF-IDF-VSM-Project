Choosing Physiology Journals .A Brodman, E. For many years administrators of library collections have sought objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections in the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry. Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined.  These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted equally. .X 31	1	198 33	1	198 36	2	198 37	1	198 41	2	198 46	1	198 76	1	198 89	1	198 181	1	198 182	1	198 183	2	198 184	2	198 185	1	198 193	2	198 195	2	198 196	1	198 198	8	198 199	1	198 201	3	198 203	1	198 204	1	198 211	1	198 217	1	198 220	1	198 269	1	198 361	1	198 379	1	198 395	1	198 415	1	198 543	1	198 545	1	198 552	1	198 588	1	198 614	1	198 616	2	198 632	1	198 635	1	198 638	1	198 685	1	198 735	3	198 760	1	198 766	1	198 767	1	198 774	1	198 775	1	198 778	1	198 784	1	198 789	1	198 821	1	198 828	1	198 831	1	198 891	2	198 905	2	198 952	2	198 953	1	198 964	1	198 968	1	198 1009	1	198 1018	1	198 1019	1	198 1055	1	198 1071	1	198 1147	1	198 1210	1	198 1240	1	198 1260	1	198 1275	5	198 1276	1	198 1290	1	198 1302	4	198 1355	1	198 1359	1	198 1397	3	198 1417	1	198 1432	1	198 1432	1	198
