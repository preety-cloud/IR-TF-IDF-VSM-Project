Use Made of Technical Libraries .A Slater, M. This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways. .X 2	5	2 32	1	2 76	1	2 132	1	2 137	1	2 139	1	2 152	2	2 155	1	2 158	1	2 183	1	2 195	1	2 203	1	2 204	1	2 210	1	2 243	1	2 371	1	2 475	1	2 552	1	2 760	1	2 770	1	2 771	1	2 774	1	2 775	1	2 776	1	2 788	1	2 789	1	2 801	1	2 815	1	2 839	1	2 977	1	2 1055	1	2 1056	1	2 1151	1	2 1361	1	2 1414	1	2 1451	1	2 1451	1	2
