The Age of Jewett: Charles Coffin Jewett and American Librarianship 1841-1868 .A Harris, M.M. Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter. But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era, and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding of the American Library Association. .X 8	1	20 20	6	20 42	1	20 60	1	20 85	1	20 129	1	20 171	1	20 172	1	20 237	1	20 469	1	20 585	1	20 599	1	20 640	1	20 652	1	20 665	1	20 762	1	20 803	1	20 909	1	20 918	1	20 1022	1	20 1045	1	20 1061	1	20 1268	1	20 1453	2	20 1453	2	20
