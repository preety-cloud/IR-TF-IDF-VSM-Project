Medical Libraries and the Assessment of User Needs .A Rees, Alan M. Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great detail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and searching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires.. Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow, the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs, since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs.. Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors.. Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout.. It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment.. .X 18	1	202 33	1	202 34	1	202 36	1	202 42	1	202 49	1	202 53	1	202 59	1	202 90	1	202 132	1	202 161	1	202 164	1	202 183	1	202 184	2	202 193	2	202 199	1	202 201	1	202 202	6	202 203	2	202 204	1	202 205	1	202 209	1	202 210	1	202 212	1	202 213	1	202 217	1	202 220	1	202 222	1	202 224	1	202 243	1	202 284	1	202 286	1	202 294	1	202 421	1	202 465	1	202 466	1	202 490	1	202 491	1	202 506	1	202 507	1	202 510	1	202 512	1	202 543	1	202 588	1	202 591	1	202 595	1	202 603	1	202 604	1	202 613	1	202 622	1	202 623	1	202 624	1	202 629	1	202 633	1	202 639	1	202 659	1	202 676	1	202 711	1	202 722	1	202 723	1	202 726	1	202 728	1	202 730	1	202 731	1	202 732	1	202 799	1	202 800	1	202 808	1	202 809	1	202 810	1	202 813	1	202 814	1	202 820	1	202 822	1	202 828	1	202 870	1	202 879	1	202 891	1	202 928	1	202 959	1	202 965	1	202 973	1	202 1091	1	202 1151	1	202 1283	1	202 1298	1	202 1299	1	202 1363	1	202 1366	1	202 1367	1	202 1368	1	202 1396	1	202 1396	1	202
