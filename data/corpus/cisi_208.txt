Development of Methodologic Tools for Planning and Managing Library Services: III. Standardized Inventories of Library Services .A Orr, Richard H. .A Pings, Vern M. .A Olson, Edwin E. .A Pizer, Irwin H. A standardized procedure was developed for eliciting those details for a library's service policies that are important to its users and for recording the data by checking appropriate categories on a form.. This inventory procedure covers the entire spectrum of user services and accommodates a wide range of policies.. The inventory was originally designed for use by trained interviewers in large-scale surveys of academic medical libraries.. However, it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide and Checklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to survey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative, managerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categorical inventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes it possible to calculate scores indicating how a library's policies compare with those of an "optimal" library.. An analogous inventory of the services a library provides to other libraries was developed for surveying major backup resources in the medical library system.. .X 31	1	208 46	1	208 61	1	208 67	1	208 70	1	208 71	1	208 72	1	208 73	1	208 135	1	208 175	1	208 181	2	208 206	8	208 207	6	208 208	12	208 217	2	208 222	1	208 223	1	208 245	1	208 266	2	208 270	1	208 272	1	208 277	1	208 282	1	208 358	1	208 382	1	208 385	1	208 408	2	208 415	1	208 458	1	208 481	1	208 483	1	208 485	1	208 591	1	208 748	1	208 779	1	208 780	1	208 816	1	208 891	1	208 925	2	208 962	1	208 964	3	208 970	1	208 976	2	208 981	1	208 982	1	208 1005	2	208 1007	1	208 1018	1	208 1056	1	208 1205	1	208 1317	2	208 1358	1	208 1384	1	208 1400	1	208 1402	1	208 1407	1	208 1410	1	208 1417	1	208 1417	1	208
