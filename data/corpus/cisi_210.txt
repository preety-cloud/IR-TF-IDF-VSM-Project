Survey of Medical Literature Borrowed from the National Lending Library for Science and Technology .A Wood, David N. .A Bower, Cathryn A. This paper reports the results of a four-week questionnaire survey carried out at the National Lending Library (N.L.L.), Great Britian, to discover which types of organizations were the principal users of medical literature, what types of literature were used, and which were the main sources of references to medical publications..Industrial organizations and universities accounted for the majority (62 percent) of the loans, most of which were English-language periodicals published since 1960.. For the whole sample, citation list in periodical articles were the principal sources of references, although for literature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexing journals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be the most fruitful source of references.. By asking whether the item requested was really useful to their work, a measure of the reliability of the different sources of references was obtained.. Appendixes include the questionnaire, a list of the most frequently borrowed journals, and a list of abstracting and indexing journals used as sources of references.. .X 2	1	210 24	1	210 33	1	210 36	1	210 41	1	210 55	1	210 62	1	210 65	1	210 66	1	210 75	1	210 76	2	210 89	1	210 97	1	210 102	1	210 111	1	210 112	1	210 132	1	210 137	2	210 139	1	210 147	1	210 152	1	210 155	1	210 163	1	210 183	3	210 184	1	210 193	2	210 195	1	210 196	1	210 199	1	210 201	1	210 202	1	210 203	5	210 204	2	210 205	1	210 210	11	210 219	1	210 225	3	210 269	1	210 278	1	210 279	1	210 280	1	210 355	1	210 359	1	210 373	1	210 386	1	210 395	1	210 398	1	210 475	1	210 545	1	210 552	2	210 587	1	210 605	1	210 613	1	210 614	2	210 638	1	210 658	1	210 716	1	210 735	1	210 747	1	210 748	2	210 750	1	210 753	1	210 760	1	210 763	1	210 766	1	210 767	1	210 774	1	210 775	2	210 782	2	210 784	1	210 788	5	210 789	3	210 793	1	210 800	1	210 808	1	210 837	1	210 905	1	210 925	1	210 953	1	210 977	2	210 983	1	210 986	1	210 1016	1	210 1023	1	210 1030	1	210 1050	1	210 1055	3	210 1056	1	210 1083	1	210 1086	1	210 1087	1	210 1090	1	210 1135	1	210 1254	1	210 1260	1	210 1275	1	210 1276	1	210 1278	1	210 1280	1	210 1285	1	210 1286	1	210 1287	1	210 1291	1	210 1302	1	210 1335	1	210 1361	1	210 1369	1	210 1390	1	210 1397	1	210 1400	1	210 1404	2	210 1417	1	210 1428	1	210 1432	1	210 1451	1	210 1451	1	210
