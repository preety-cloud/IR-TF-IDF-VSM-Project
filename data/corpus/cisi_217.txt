User Services Offered By Medical School Libraries in 1968: Results of a National Survey Employing New Methodology .A Orr, Richard H. .A Bloomquist, Harold .A Cruzat, Gwendolyn S. .A Schless, Arthur P. The breadth and depth of services that ninety-two medical school libraries offer to individual user were ascertained by interviewing the heads of these libraries, employing a standardized inventory procedure developed earlier (Bulletin 56:380-403, Oct.1968).. Selected aspects of the descriptive data obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of services.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services.. One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services relative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single figure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical regions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey data for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most important of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - activities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and recommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate for the Medical Library Association.. .X 33	1	217 36	2	217 90	1	217 161	1	217 172	1	217 181	1	217 183	1	217 184	1	217 185	1	217 193	1	217 198	1	217 199	1	217 201	2	217 202	1	217 203	1	217 204	1	217 205	1	217 206	1	217 207	2	217 208	2	217 209	1	217 211	2	217 212	1	217 214	1	217 216	1	217 217	8	217 218	1	217 220	3	217 222	2	217 223	1	217 243	1	217 249	1	217 284	1	217 286	1	217 294	1	217 364	1	217 385	1	217 502	1	217 543	1	217 588	1	217 591	1	217 598	1	217 613	1	217 624	1	217 748	1	217 779	1	217 799	1	217 800	1	217 808	1	217 811	1	217 816	1	217 891	3	217 959	1	217 962	1	217 964	1	217 1030	1	217 1147	1	217 1151	1	217 1275	1	217 1397	1	217 1403	1	217 1403	1	217
