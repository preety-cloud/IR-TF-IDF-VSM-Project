The Medical Library Assistance Act: An Analysis of the NLM Extramural Programs, 1965-1970 .A Cummings, Martin M. .A Corning, Mary E. The imbalance between medical library resources and information needs of the health professional led to a reexamination of the mandate for the National Library of Medicine.. Legislation known as the Medical Library Assistance Act (MLAA) was passed in 1965 which enabled the NLM to (1) initiate programs to assist the nation's medical libraries and (2) develop a medical library network with the establishment of regional medical libraries to link the NLM with local institutions.. The National Library of Medicine, through the MLAA, has made available $40.8 million to the medical library community under a competitive grant and contract mechanism for the period July 1965 - June 1970.. A total of 604 projects has been executed in resources, research and development, training, construction, regional medical libraries, publications, and special scientific projects.. An assessment is given of each of these programs and their impact on both the National Library of Medicine and individual medical libraries.. In the aggregate, these programs have significantly improved library and information services to the professional health user.. The principal limitation has been inadequate funding to accomplish the level of originally stated objectives.. .X 33	1	220 36	2	220 90	1	220 161	1	220 172	1	220 182	1	220 183	1	220 184	1	220 185	2	220 186	1	220 193	1	220 198	1	220 199	1	220 201	2	220 202	1	220 203	1	220 204	1	220 205	1	220 209	1	220 211	2	220 212	1	220 214	1	220 216	1	220 217	3	220 218	1	220 220	8	220 222	1	220 284	1	220 286	1	220 294	1	220 543	1	220 588	1	220 613	1	220 624	1	220 799	1	220 800	1	220 808	1	220 891	4	220 959	1	220 1030	1	220 1147	1	220 1151	1	220 1275	1	220 1397	1	220 1397	1	220
