Document Delivery Capabilities of Major Biomedical Libraries in 1968: Results of a National Survey Employing Standardized Tests .A Orr, Richard H. .A Schless, Arthur P. The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin 56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical Library Association.. .X 5	1	223 9	1	223 14	1	223 90	1	223 91	1	223 128	1	223 129	1	223 130	1	223 153	1	223 158	1	223 167	1	223 170	1	223 207	1	223 208	1	223 217	1	223 222	4	223 223	6	223 225	1	223 234	1	223 266	1	223 271	1	223 280	1	223 296	1	223 297	1	223 298	1	223 300	1	223 301	1	223 302	1	223 358	1	223 364	1	223 368	1	223 393	1	223 435	1	223 468	1	223 494	1	223 515	1	223 535	1	223 550	1	223 591	1	223 615	1	223 625	1	223 629	1	223 631	1	223 634	1	223 639	1	223 646	1	223 647	1	223 651	1	223 765	1	223 791	1	223 792	1	223 811	1	223 815	2	223 816	2	223 818	2	223 822	1	223 823	2	223 827	1	223 843	1	223 844	1	223 846	1	223 915	1	223 925	1	223 943	1	223 944	1	223 945	1	223 957	1	223 961	1	223 962	2	223 964	2	223 994	1	223 1015	1	223 1019	1	223 1023	1	223 1028	1	223 1070	1	223 1085	1	223 1086	1	223 1090	1	223 1219	1	223 1227	1	223 1242	1	223 1247	1	223 1268	1	223 1354	1	223 1365	1	223 1374	1	223 1390	2	223 1401	1	223 1424	1	223 1437	1	223 1437	1	223
