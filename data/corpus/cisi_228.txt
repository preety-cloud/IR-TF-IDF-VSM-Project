A Mathematical Theory of Communication .A Shannon, C.E. The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. .X 19	2	228 73	1	228 149	1	228 175	1	228 228	18	228 229	10	228 318	1	228 321	3	228 324	1	228 329	3	228 359	1	228 389	1	228 390	1	228 416	3	228 442	3	228 450	2	228 469	1	228 494	1	228 495	2	228 505	1	228 511	3	228 521	1	228 524	3	228 536	1	228 540	1	228 563	1	228 565	1	228 567	1	228 574	1	228 587	1	228 599	1	228 700	1	228 750	1	228 751	1	228 792	1	228 803	1	228 804	1	228 835	2	228 851	2	228 862	2	228 867	2	228 875	1	228 1082	2	228 1085	1	228 1086	1	228 1194	3	228 1199	3	228 1224	1	228 1232	1	228 1274	1	228 1282	1	228 1313	1	228 1396	1	228 1398	1	228 1398	1	228
