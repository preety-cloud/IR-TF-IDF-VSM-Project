A Mathematical Theory of Communication .A Shannon, C.E. In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest. .X 19	1	229 73	1	229 149	1	229 175	1	229 228	10	229 229	10	229 321	1	229 329	1	229 359	1	229 469	1	229 494	1	229 521	1	229 540	1	229 574	1	229 587	1	229 700	1	229 750	1	229 751	1	229 792	1	229 804	1	229 867	1	229 1082	1	229 1085	1	229 1086	1	229 1199	1	229 1224	1	229 1232	1	229 1274	1	229 1282	1	229 1313	1	229 1313	1	229
