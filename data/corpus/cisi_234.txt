Book Availability and the Library User .A Buckland, M.K. The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library services. .X 5	1	234 115	2	234 128	1	234 129	1	234 130	1	234 167	1	234 207	2	234 223	1	234 225	1	234 234	14	234 236	1	234 245	1	234 280	1	234 303	1	234 304	1	234 306	1	234 338	1	234 361	1	234 364	1	234 365	1	234 393	1	234 433	1	234 468	1	234 494	1	234 502	1	234 638	1	234 639	1	234 646	2	234 647	2	234 651	2	234 764	2	234 765	1	234 811	3	234 816	2	234 818	2	234 822	1	234 823	2	234 827	1	234 842	1	234 925	3	234 942	1	234 943	2	234 944	3	234 948	3	234 963	1	234 1017	1	234 1023	1	234 1049	1	234 1070	1	234 1085	1	234 1206	1	234 1237	1	234 1257	1	234 1374	1	234 1378	1	234 1390	1	234 1401	1	234 1437	1	234 1440	1	234 1450	1	234 1453	1	234 1453	1	234
