Book Catalogs .A Tauber, M.F. In the intervening years since the appearance of the first collection of papers concerning book catalogs (Kingery, Robert E., and Tauber, Maurice F., Book Catalogs, N.Y., The Scarecrow Press, 1963), attention has been concentrated on the book catalog as a substitute for, or an auxiliary to the card catalog. This selection of papers has identified some of the efforts to solve particular problems concerned with book catalogs.  The published papers, as well as those which have been written specifically for this volume, bring additional observations concerning the place of the book catalog in library services. .X 16	1	235 92	1	235 235	11	235 246	1	235 247	1	235 250	1	235 289	2	235 291	1	235 326	1	235 333	1	235 404	1	235 548	1	235 594	1	235 597	1	235 598	1	235 601	2	235 836	1	235 848	1	235 863	2	235 864	2	235 865	1	235 866	1	235 868	1	235 897	2	235 916	1	235 936	1	235 950	1	235 991	1	235 997	1	235 1000	1	235 1052	1	235 1152	2	235 1153	1	235 1216	1	235 1248	1	235 1266	1	235 1392	1	235 1395	1	235 1441	1	235 1441	1	235
