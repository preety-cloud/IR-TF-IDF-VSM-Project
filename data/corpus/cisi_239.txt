Buyers and Borrowers .A Mann, P.H. This is the second book based on studies into social aspects of book reading. The present book is largely a report on work which was carried out in 1967-68 but either not analysed or written up in time for the first book, or work actually carried out and analysed during the second year's research.  The reader of this book will find it useful to have read the first book, but the present book is self-contained and does not require reference to the first one. .X 239	5	239 358	2	239 946	2	239 1005	2	239 1018	1	239 1032	2	239 1056	2	239 1145	2	239 1227	1	239 1240	1	239 1240	1	239
