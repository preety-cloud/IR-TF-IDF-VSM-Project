Books for Junior College Libraries .A Ririe, J.W. The primary purpose of this publication is to serve as a book selection guide for junior and community college libraries, whether long established, newly established, or in the planning and preinstruction stage.  The need for a new and authoritative book list has long been expressed by administrators, faculty members, and librarians.  It is hoped that the present list will meet this need, and that it will also be useful in four-year colleges, with special reference to their lower-division work; in secondary schools, especially where accelerated and honors programs or courses for advanced college placement are offered; and in public libraries seeking to satisfy the demands of high school and college students. .X 7	1	240 240	5	240 262	1	240 322	1	240 1028	1	240 1211	1	240 1212	1	240 1266	1	240 1424	1	240 1424	1	240
