A Brief guide to Sources of Scientific and Technical Information .A Hermer, S. This guide is a recapitulation and refinement of the substantive content of a one-and-a-half day course which was given before three groups of Federal scientists and engineers during the Fall of 1967.  Its purpose was to train and inform working scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficient means of seeking and acquiring work-related information. The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing need for working scientists and engineers to share and participate in the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms, and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer approaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination. A further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate the fullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are likely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional activities. .X 119	1	241 214	1	241 232	1	241 241	6	241 331	1	241 355	1	241 358	1	241 382	1	241 406	1	241 408	1	241 458	1	241 896	1	241 916	1	241 946	1	241 948	1	241 986	1	241 1012	1	241 1033	1	241 1079	1	241 1084	1	241 1249	1	241 1254	1	241 1379	1	241 1403	1	241 1403	1	241
