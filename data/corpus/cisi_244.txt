Case Studies in Library Computer Systems .A Palmer, R.P. Case Studies in Library Computer Systems does not follow the mode of the other volumes in this series because none of the persons, libraries or systems is disguised.  Neither has information been withheld to force readers tp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, all systems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptive case studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully utilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method rather than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context of a real library environment and against the background of particular institutional service objectives. .X 10	1	244 120	1	244 128	1	244 135	1	244 141	1	244 190	1	244 225	1	244 244	8	244 245	1	244 291	1	244 299	1	244 304	1	244 305	1	244 306	1	244 358	1	244 365	1	244 385	1	244 394	1	244 433	1	244 459	2	244 529	1	244 534	1	244 575	1	244 599	1	244 621	1	244 630	2	244 692	1	244 702	1	244 731	1	244 732	1	244 817	1	244 820	1	244 822	1	244 823	1	244 825	1	244 826	1	244 827	1	244 828	1	244 854	1	244 871	1	244 872	1	244 873	1	244 874	1	244 875	1	244 876	1	244 877	1	244 878	1	244 879	1	244 880	1	244 892	1	244 925	1	244 940	1	244 941	1	244 947	1	244 948	1	244 990	1	244 994	1	244 997	1	244 998	1	244 1017	1	244 1058	1	244 1079	1	244 1143	1	244 1146	1	244 1230	2	244 1257	2	244 1303	1	244 1390	1	244 1396	1	244 1402	1	244 1435	1	244 1436	1	244 1436	1	244
