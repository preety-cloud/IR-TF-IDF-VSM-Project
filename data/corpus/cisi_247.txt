Cataloging U.S.A. .A Dunkin, P.S. The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Only now and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of the implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly described. It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and description, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or other similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such works, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of what seem to be the most important aspects of each. Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States. Many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging abroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken several books.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If a reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful, that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging. I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in this country will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  In no sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism. .X 30	1	247 71	1	247 75	1	247 77	1	247 78	1	247 79	1	247 80	1	247 81	1	247 82	1	247 83	1	247 92	1	247 154	1	247 212	1	247 235	1	247 246	2	247 247	8	247 326	1	247 333	1	247 581	1	247 666	1	247 838	1	247 853	1	247 950	1	247 991	2	247 997	1	247 1000	1	247 1004	1	247 1153	1	247 1216	1	247 1265	2	247 1266	1	247 1393	1	247 1395	1	247 1431	1	247 1441	1	247 1441	1	247
