Centralized Processing for Academic Libraries; final report of the Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center; the first six months of operation .A Doughtery, R.M. This is the final report of the Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC) project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965 by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort to establish a centralized acquisition and processing center.  The report of Phase I-II, completed in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility study, the design of the central system, costs of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a number of related concerns such as accounting, the congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward library services. This report focuses on the experimental operations which were concluded officially on September 30, 1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the theory and principles upon which a system might be based, we are presently concerned with the pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved. Although this report deals primarily with cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe it also contributes to a better understanding of cooperative programs.  The experiment was designed to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/ cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements were made on most internal and external aspects of the system.  Monitoring also extended into the participating libraries where a product acceptance study was conducted.  A secondary objective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participants and the central agency, such as the interface of systems and the human interaction of participants and the Center. .X 16	1	250 214	1	250 218	1	250 235	1	250 249	2	250 250	8	250 289	1	250 295	1	250 340	1	250 348	1	250 365	1	250 375	1	250 394	1	250 404	1	250 408	1	250 855	1	250 863	1	250 864	1	250 872	1	250 897	1	250 938	1	250 974	1	250 981	1	250 984	1	250 986	1	250 1012	1	250 1152	1	250 1188	1	250 1247	1	250 1257	1	250 1317	1	250 1379	1	250 1390	1	250 1392	1	250 1410	1	250 1410	1	250
