Chemical and Engineering News .A Tate, F.A. Chemical Abstracts Service, along with the entire ACS publications program, is converting to a computer base.  This change in our basic method of handling information will provide powerful new tools for chemists and chemical engineers to meet their information needs. Our goal is a unified system that will produce both a full, printed record of chemical and chemical engineering knowledge and a variety of timely, special-subject alerting services, simultaneously providing a mechanized match and retrieval system that is sufficiently flexible to meet the varied needs of information users.  The output will be supplied in whatever form best suits the user's needs - printed pages, microfilm, or computer-searchable tapes.  Tapes and search programs will be usable on the customer's computer, or CAS will provide custom matches of its own computer files. .X 34	1	252 53	1	252 165	1	252 252	6	252 254	1	252 347	2	252 480	1	252 565	1	252 641	1	252 671	1	252 673	1	252 674	1	252 676	1	252 680	1	252 683	1	252 687	1	252 689	1	252 711	1	252 714	1	252 715	1	252 746	1	252 1452	1	252 1452	1	252
