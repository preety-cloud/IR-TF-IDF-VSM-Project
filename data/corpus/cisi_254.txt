Chemical Information Systems .A Hyde, E. Ash, J.E. The purpose of a chemical information system must not be restricted to the storage and retrieval of facts.  It is equally important that the system shall provide methods which enable a scientist to assemble and to correlate the facts.  Chemical information systems are required primarily as a service to research chemists to enable them to keep up to date with current developments in their fields of interest, and the establishment of information services has relieved the chemist of many of his problems of literature searching and information storage and organization. .X 116	1	254 117	1	254 165	1	254 252	1	254 254	7	254 327	3	254 347	1	254 568	2	254 641	2	254 668	2	254 670	1	254 671	2	254 673	2	254 677	1	254 678	1	254 679	1	254 682	1	254 683	1	254 687	1	254 689	2	254 690	2	254 693	1	254 694	1	254 695	1	254 698	1	254 700	1	254 704	1	254 706	1	254 707	1	254 714	1	254 730	2	254 738	1	254 833	1	254 890	2	254 1026	1	254 1072	1	254 1092	2	254 1292	1	254 1452	2	254 1452	2	254
