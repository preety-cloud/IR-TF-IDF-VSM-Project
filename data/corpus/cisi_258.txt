Classification and Indexing in Science .A Vickery, B.C. .B 1959 The first problem, that of learning of a publication's existence, is tackled by a multiplicity of abstracting and indexing journals and other bibliographies, and, at local levels, by library catalogues and unnecessary overlapping among these services, while ensuring adequately comprehensive coverage, are very great.  But even if these were overcome, problems of the internal arrangement of these bibliographical aids would still remain.  It is not enough for them collectively to record every scientific publication.  The user must be able to find every such record, starting only with a subject on which he wants information. .X 149	1	258 160	1	258 168	1	258 258	5	258 263	1	258 388	2	258 477	1	258 480	1	258 516	1	258 558	1	258 746	1	258 758	1	258 761	1	258 817	1	258 825	1	258 1066	1	258 1215	1	258 1230	1	258 1231	1	258 1259	1	258 1309	1	258 1391	2	258 1405	1	258 1414	1	258 1414	1	258
