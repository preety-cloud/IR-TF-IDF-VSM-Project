Classification and Indexing in Science .A Vickery, B.C. .B 1975 The preface to the first edition of this book - which is reproduced following this - shows that in 1958 the classification ideas in it were felt to be controversial, needing to be championed.  A few years before, the Classification Research Group had issued a memorandum proclaiming 'the need for a faceted classification as the basis of all methods of information retrieval.'  As part-author of this memorandum, I must now judge the claim to have been too bold, even brash.  But it has been vindicated to an extent, for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis, in the organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search, has been widely accepted - whether these vocabularies are classified or alphabetical, and whether used in pre- or post-coordinate fashion. .X 259	6	259 434	1	259 445	1	259 449	1	259 476	1	259 477	1	259 542	1	259 758	1	259 874	1	259 1215	1	259 1231	1	259 1255	1	259 1259	1	259 1265	1	259 1391	1	259 1448	1	259 1448	1	259
