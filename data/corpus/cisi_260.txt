Classification Practice in Britain.  Report on a survey of classification opinion and practice in Great Britain, with particular reference to the Dewey Decimal Classification .A Davison, K. The objectives of the Sub-Committee in starting their enquiries were basically three-fold 1) To gather a reasonable collection of statistics relating to the general practice of classification in this country. 2) To gather information on th actual use of the Dewey Decimal Classification in this country. 3) To provide a basis for the recommendations which are provided periodically for the Dewey Editorial Policy Committee from the Library Association Library Research Committee's Sub-Committee on Dewey Decimal Classification Revision. To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  The result of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority completed correctly.  The actual figures of type and size of library are given in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omitted and a significant proportion of the larger libraries returned the questionnaire. .X 154	1	260 159	1	260 257	1	260 260	6	260 476	1	260 797	1	260 801	1	260 989	1	260 1066	1	260 1231	1	260 1255	1	260 1268	1	260 1394	1	260 1429	1	260 1430	1	260 1430	1	260
