Classification Scheme for Law Books .A Moys, E.M. An examination made over a period of years of the principles of classifying law books for use in libraries, and of their treatment in many general and specialized classification schemes convinced me that no scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in English- speaking countries outside the United States.  Law collections in academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general and special, academic and professional, in these countries. .X 29	1	261 68	1	261 69	1	261 90	1	261 175	1	261 231	1	261 261	5	261 295	1	261 299	1	261 334	1	261 346	1	261 354	2	261 382	1	261 458	1	261 476	1	261 477	1	261 478	1	261 479	1	261 480	1	261 484	1	261 485	1	261 566	1	261 608	1	261 610	1	261 617	1	261 620	1	261 680	1	261 704	1	261 781	1	261 815	1	261 938	1	261 939	1	261 991	1	261 992	1	261 1118	1	261 1175	1	261 1221	1	261 1318	1	261 1365	1	261 1390	1	261 1390	1	261
