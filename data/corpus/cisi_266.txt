Quantitative Criteria for Adequacy of Academic Library Collection .A Clapp, Verner W. .A Jordan, Robert T. The authors challenge accepted doctrine which asserts that the adequacy of an academic library cannot be measured by the number of books which it contains.. Out of their feeling that the Standards for College Libraries and the Standards for Junior College Libraries are inadequate for estimating the size (in volumes) required for minimum adequacy by libraries of institutions of higher education of widely differing characteristics, they developed new formulas for this purpose.. These formulas attempt to identify the principal factors affecting academic needs for books and to ascribe suitable to each factor.. The authors then illustrate the application of the formulas to specific institutions, and conclude that while the results are useful, further research in needed.. They end by suggesting specific topics for such research.. .X 14	1	266 31	1	266 46	1	266 153	1	266 170	2	266 206	2	266 207	2	266 208	2	266 223	1	266 245	1	266 266	15	266 271	2	266 275	1	266 277	2	266 282	2	266 288	1	266 290	1	266 305	1	266 307	1	266 408	1	266 550	1	266 925	1	266 964	2	266 976	1	266 1005	1	266 1019	1	266 1028	1	266 1086	1	266 1090	1	266 1400	1	266 1424	1	266 1424	1	266
