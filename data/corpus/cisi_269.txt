Sampling and Short-Period Usage in the Purdue Library .A Jain, A. K. Several possible methods of sampling of social science monograph titles in the general library of Purdue University were considered, and a "good" method was used to obtain estimates of their usage in the library and at home during the period July 1 - August 4, 1964.. The term relative usage was defined and used to study the effect of: (1) language, (2) country of publication, (3) year of publication, and (4) year of accession of a monograph title.. An attempt was made to fit a regression model for titles in English by quantifying the last three independent variables with relative usage as the dependent variable.. Functions based on the above variables have been developed to identify monograph titles for storage.. A questionnaire was employed to stady the usage of library facilities and to gather opinions of library patrons.. Purpose of visiting the library, reason for checkout of library material, reason for preferring library or home for the use of library material, etc., were analyzed on the basis of the replies received.. .X 31	2	269 33	1	269 36	3	269 41	2	269 46	3	269 89	1	269 97	1	269 102	1	269 111	1	269 112	1	269 163	1	269 181	1	269 182	1	269 183	3	269 184	2	269 193	3	269 195	1	269 198	1	269 199	1	269 201	2	269 203	1	269 210	1	269 225	1	269 269	5	269 280	1	269 373	1	269 395	1	269 415	1	269 545	1	269 552	1	269 587	1	269 605	1	269 613	1	269 614	1	269 638	1	269 735	1	269 747	1	269 750	1	269 753	1	269 760	1	269 766	1	269 767	3	269 774	1	269 775	1	269 778	1	269 782	1	269 784	1	269 788	1	269 789	1	269 793	1	269 800	1	269 808	1	269 891	1	269 905	2	269 925	1	269 952	1	269 953	2	269 964	1	269 968	1	269 977	2	269 983	1	269 1009	1	269 1016	1	269 1018	1	269 1019	2	269 1023	1	269 1030	1	269 1055	1	269 1087	1	269 1090	1	269 1135	1	269 1203	1	269 1240	1	269 1260	1	269 1275	1	269 1276	1	269 1278	1	269 1280	1	269 1285	1	269 1286	1	269 1287	1	269 1302	1	269 1335	1	269 1352	1	269 1359	1	269 1390	1	269 1397	2	269 1416	2	269 1417	3	269 1428	1	269 1432	1	269 1451	1	269 1451	1	269
