Cost Analysis and Simulation Procedures for the Evaluation of Large Information Systems .A Bourne, C.P. Ford, D.F. A computer program has been written and used which simulates the several-year operation of an information system and computes estimates of the expected operating costs as well as the amount of equipment and personnel required during that time period.  The program has been used for the analysis of several large systems and has proven itself to be a useful research tool for the study of systems with so many components and interrelated operations that an equivalent manual analysis would be extremely cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even impractical. This paper describes this program and shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation of two of several suggested designs for a specific information system. .X 27	5	27 67	1	27 74	1	27 83	1	27 158	1	27 211	1	27 324	1	27 474	1	27 490	1	27 491	1	27 492	1	27 495	1	27 496	1	27 497	1	27 584	1	27 591	1	27 976	1	27 976	1	27
