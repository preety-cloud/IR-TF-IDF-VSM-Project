Determining and Allocating Book Funds for Current Domestic Buying .A McGrath, William E. A device is outlined to help formulate the annual book budget request.. Courses described in the college catalog are matched with the books listed in the American Book Publishing Record, BPR, Cumulative 1965.. Courses, treated as if monographes, are designed Dewey classification numbers and arranged in decimal sequence by groups.. Books in BPR falling into the groups are tallied; the DC groups are then rearranged by departments and the number and cost of books in each are totaled.. Results are sound estimates of each department's probable current domestic book needs for that year and may be applied to the subsequent year as an estimate of what will probably be needed.. They may be used as factors in an allocation formula.. .X 14	1	271 153	1	271 170	1	271 223	1	271 249	1	271 266	2	271 271	6	271 275	2	271 277	1	271 282	1	271 305	2	271 307	1	271 550	1	271 591	1	271 981	1	271 1019	1	271 1028	1	271 1086	1	271 1090	1	271 1424	1	271 1424	1	271
