Measuring Classified Circulation According to Curriculum .A McGrath, Wiiliam E. Circulation statistics can be precise reflections of library use according to the curriculum.. The statistics can help the librarian decide how to allocate the budget to departments.. Traditional counts, by department personnel or by broad Dewey or LC classes, are imprecise.. An analogy between curriculum and circulation can be constructed by classifying courses in the college catalog (by DC or LC), rearranging the numbers thus generated by department, and then counting circulation within those groups.. The analogy is thus a quantitative measure and a precise reflection of library use according to curriculum.. .X 266	1	275 271	2	275 275	5	275 277	2	275 282	2	275 305	2	275 307	1	275 975	1	275 975	1	275
