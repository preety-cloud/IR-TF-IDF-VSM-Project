An Allocation Formula Derived from a Factor Analysis of Academic Department .A McGrath, William E. .A Huntsinger, Ralph C. .A Barber, Gary R. The authors derive a book fund distribution formula from a factor analysis of twenty-two variables which measure and quantify academic departments.. The analysis generates a 22 x 22 matrix of correlations.. A few of the significant correlations are discussed; e.g. those between books published and books circulated (high correlation) and circulation-by-subject and circulation-by-person (low correlation).. The factor analysis sorts out the complex relationships between the twenty-two variables and reduces them to three main factors - two of which seem to describe materials used and users.. The third may describe needs.. The three factors are the chief elements in the formula.. Each factor can be represented by any one or more of the variables in that factor.. .X 71	1	277 72	1	277 73	1	277 74	1	277 75	1	277 77	1	277 78	1	277 79	1	277 81	1	277 82	1	277 83	1	277 86	1	277 153	1	277 156	1	277 206	1	277 207	1	277 208	1	277 211	1	277 212	1	277 245	2	277 266	2	277 271	1	277 275	2	277 277	7	277 279	1	277 280	1	277 282	4	277 290	1	277 305	2	277 408	1	277 486	1	277 591	1	277 720	1	277 748	1	277 785	1	277 786	1	277 787	1	277 788	1	277 789	1	277 791	1	277 925	2	277 943	1	277 964	1	277 975	1	277 976	1	277 984	1	277 1005	1	277 1400	1	277 1400	1	277
