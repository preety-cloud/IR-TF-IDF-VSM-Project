A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance .A Taube, M. Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on "who is master," the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity. .X 28	5	28 42	1	28 43	1	28 45	1	28 72	1	28 79	1	28 133	1	28 134	1	28 157	1	28 381	1	28 389	1	28 390	1	28 468	1	28 486	2	28 487	1	28 514	1	28 518	1	28 564	1	28 565	2	28 595	1	28 615	1	28 646	1	28 661	1	28 663	1	28 714	1	28 752	1	28 785	1	28 820	1	28 822	1	28 827	1	28 829	1	28 853	1	28 895	1	28 1091	1	28 1282	1	28 1282	1	28
