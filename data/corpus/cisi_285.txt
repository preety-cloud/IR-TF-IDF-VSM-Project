Modernizing the University Library Structure .A Kaser, D. Among the several kinds of change that appear to be in order in personnel management in university libraries, some have been described, others have not.  There has perhaps been a super-abundance of attention devoted, for example, to the inadequate treatment of librarians within the university community as a whole, but little discussion has thus far appeared in print concerning their treatment within the library itself. This paper will attempt to define certain progressive changes that it is possible and probably desirable for the library to implement internally regardless of the university's willingness to consider improving the librarian's lot in the larger community. .X 270	2	285 285	8	285 289	1	285 296	1	285 301	3	285 302	1	285 418	1	285 925	1	285 1015	4	285 1065	1	285 1069	1	285 1070	1	285 1150	1	285 1214	1	285 1233	1	285 1454	2	285 1454	2	285
