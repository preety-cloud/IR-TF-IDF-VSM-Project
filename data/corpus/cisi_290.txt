Correlation the Subjects of Books Taken Out Of and Books Used Within an Open-Stack Library .A McGrath, William E. The traditional over-the-counter circulation count is not always considered a reliable indicator of total library use.. To test this assumption the author hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out of the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments.. In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the second, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting in-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out to in, and the regression equation.. .X 46	2	290 266	1	290 277	1	290 280	1	290 282	2	290 284	1	290 290	8	290 925	2	290 943	1	290 981	1	290 1019	1	290 1023	1	290 1203	2	290 1416	1	290 1416	1	290
