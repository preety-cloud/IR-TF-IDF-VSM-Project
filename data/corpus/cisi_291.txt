A Generalized Methodology for Library Systems Analysis .A Burns, R.W. This article is directed toward the service in systems work.  Its purpose is to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can be used in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a point of view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-making and resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticated techniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however, will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming, simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian. .X 120	1	291 128	1	291 135	1	291 178	1	291 235	1	291 244	1	291 245	2	291 249	1	291 288	1	291 289	1	291 291	6	291 292	1	291 408	1	291 459	1	291 548	1	291 575	1	291 591	1	291 594	1	291 597	1	291 598	1	291 599	1	291 601	1	291 621	1	291 630	1	291 692	1	291 836	1	291 863	1	291 864	1	291 865	2	291 866	1	291 868	1	291 897	1	291 915	1	291 916	1	291 925	3	291 936	1	291 945	1	291 957	1	291 959	1	291 960	2	291 961	2	291 962	1	291 972	1	291 982	1	291 984	1	291 1007	1	291 1052	1	291 1248	1	291 1317	1	291 1353	1	291 1358	1	291 1400	2	291 1401	2	291 1402	1	291 1402	1	291
