Key Factors of Circulation System Analysis and Design .A McGee, Rob Librarians must frequently judge circulation systems on the basis of widely disparate descriptions that make comparisons difficult.. A way is needed to place  various systems into a common perspective framework, so that their similarities and differences can be readily understood.. This paper explains basic (and largely familiar) concepts and components that are common to manual, machine-aided, and computer-based systems, and documents their significance as key factors in the analysis and design of academic library circulation systems.. Cost factors are not discussed.. .X 33	1	294 36	1	294 90	2	294 161	1	294 183	1	294 184	1	294 193	1	294 199	1	294 201	1	294 202	1	294 203	1	294 204	1	294 205	1	294 209	1	294 212	1	294 217	1	294 220	1	294 222	1	294 284	1	294 286	1	294 289	2	294 294	5	294 543	1	294 553	1	294 588	1	294 612	1	294 613	1	294 617	1	294 620	1	294 624	1	294 799	1	294 800	1	294 808	1	294 849	1	294 850	1	294 897	1	294 959	1	294 963	1	294 990	1	294 1151	1	294 1221	1	294 1229	1	294 1229	1	294
