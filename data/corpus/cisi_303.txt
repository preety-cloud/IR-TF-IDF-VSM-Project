Reference-Bibliographers in the College Library .A Gration, Selby U. Young, Arthur P. One approach to making college library more relevant, dynamic, and intelligible is to employ specialists with broad subject competence, throughly familiar with the terminology, bibliographic tools, and major writings of several related disciplines.. These subject specialists or reference- bibliographers provide reference and institutional services, and serve as coordinators between academic departments and the library.. A significant increase in the quality of library service is attained with reference- bibliographers both building and interpreting the collection.. The reference- bibliographer concept is examined from several perspectives: historical antecedents; relationship to the academic setting; and the authors' experience with a staff of subject specialists at a predominantly undergraduate college library during 1969-1972.. .X 115	1	303 234	1	303 236	1	303 268	2	303 284	1	303 298	1	303 303	5	303 353	1	303 433	1	303 843	1	303 985	3	303 1008	1	303 1021	1	303 1247	1	303 1247	1	303
