Attendance and Use of the Science Library at M.I.T. .A Bush, G.C. Galliher, H.P. Morse, P.M. This is an interim report on continuing studies of library operations at Massachusetts Institute of Technology being made by members of the Institute's Operations Research Project in cooperation with the librarians and library staff.  In this report, which is based on actual observations of on-the-premise use made of the Science Library, various statistics measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use are tabulated.  In addition there are some suggested measures of effectiveness of the library. A unique outcome of the survey has been the construction and verification of a mathematical model employing probability theory to measure rate and kind of use of library material together with length of stay of library patrons. Such models, characteristic of an operations research approach, give promise of furthering the goal of effective library management and planning. .X 31	5	31 36	1	31 41	1	31 46	3	31 181	1	31 182	1	31 183	2	31 184	1	31 193	2	31 195	1	31 198	1	31 201	3	31 206	1	31 207	1	31 208	1	31 266	1	31 269	2	31 359	1	31 373	1	31 379	1	31 395	1	31 415	1	31 475	1	31 748	1	31 760	1	31 767	2	31 774	1	31 778	2	31 891	1	31 905	1	31 925	1	31 952	1	31 953	1	31 964	2	31 968	1	31 977	1	31 1009	1	31 1018	1	31 1019	2	31 1086	1	31 1173	1	31 1203	2	31 1240	1	31 1352	1	31 1359	1	31 1397	1	31 1417	1	31 1451	1	31 1451	1	31
