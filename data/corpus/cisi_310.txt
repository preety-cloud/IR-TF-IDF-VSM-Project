A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Banks .A Cod, E.F. Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution.. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed.. Changes in data representation will often be nedded as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.. Existing noninferential, formated data systems provide users with tree- structured files or slightly more general network models of the data.. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.. IN Section 2, certain operations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.. .X 45	1	310 62	1	310 174	1	310 175	1	310 310	8	310 318	4	310 363	1	310 409	1	310 422	1	310 454	1	310 455	1	310 458	1	310 462	1	310 479	1	310 483	1	310 485	1	310 564	1	310 604	1	310 661	1	310 662	1	310 663	1	310 737	1	310 745	1	310 769	1	310 853	1	310 875	1	310 883	1	310 1274	1	310 1327	1	310 1419	2	310 1427	1	310 1427	1	310
