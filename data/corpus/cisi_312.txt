Communication of Innovations:  A Cross-Cultural Approach .A Rogers, E.M. Shoemaker, F.F. In the present edition we have, to a far greater extent, integrated diffusion research with the scientific study of human communication.  Diffusion researchers have long been aware that they were investigating a special type of communication behavior.  In this book we stress communication concepts and frameworks in our analysis of the diffusion process.  We feel this provides an advantage of conceptual clarity as well as ease of wide expression.  Our adoption of the communication viewpoint is reflected in the addition of several chapters, the complete reorganization of all chapters, and the frequent inclusion of new concepts. .X 89	1	312 95	1	312 102	1	312 105	1	312 113	1	312 191	1	312 312	6	312 356	3	312 436	2	312 437	1	312 456	1	312 459	1	312 475	1	312 544	1	312 560	1	312 594	1	312 602	1	312 728	1	312 1030	1	312 1036	1	312 1041	1	312 1045	1	312 1050	1	312 1154	1	312 1187	1	312 1284	1	312 1291	1	312 1296	1	312 1300	1	312 1303	1	312 1333	1	312 1346	1	312 1386	1	312 1406	1	312 1406	1	312
