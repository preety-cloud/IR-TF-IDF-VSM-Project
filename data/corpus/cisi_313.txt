Communication among Scientists and Engineers .A Nelson, C. E. In the course of collecting data on nine scientific and technological disciplines, it has become obvious to us that in their communication activities, some disciplines behave quite differently from others.. Recently, we have reanalyzed our data for the physical, the engineering, and the social sciences.. We do not have time to discuss differences among all three groups, so we have decided to compare only the physical and social sciences.. We have included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs, however, so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups.. Before discussing these differences, we should like to emphasize that there are similarities, that there are of major importance, and that they, in fact, make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible.. We will discuss differences between the physical and the social sciences in terms of three major communication characteristics associated with science.. .X 15	2	313 19	1	313 37	1	313 39	1	313 40	1	313 47	1	313 88	1	313 97	1	313 102	1	313 103	1	313 152	1	313 233	1	313 253	1	313 313	5	313 359	1	313 377	1	313 379	1	313 395	1	313 447	1	313 449	1	313 505	1	313 560	1	313 573	1	313 574	1	313 585	1	313 618	1	313 625	1	313 632	1	313 635	1	313 667	1	313 748	1	313 749	1	313 751	1	313 764	1	313 765	1	313 777	1	313 778	1	313 782	1	313 803	1	313 804	1	313 805	1	313 893	1	313 952	1	313 1016	1	313 1061	1	313 1085	1	313 1086	1	313 1087	1	313 1182	1	313 1200	1	313 1274	1	313 1277	1	313 1278	1	313 1280	1	313 1287	1	313 1301	1	313 1302	1	313 1304	1	313 1313	1	313 1319	1	313 1321	2	313 1338	1	313 1344	1	313 1347	1	313 1380	1	313 1386	2	313 1408	1	313 1428	1	313 1444	1	313 1444	1	313
