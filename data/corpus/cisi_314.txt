Citation Measures of Hard Science, Soft Science, Technology and Nonscience .A de Solla Price, D. Perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content. Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics. My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic conference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest and most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, but rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity, and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised. I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to solving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear, however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success, whatever solutions ultimately emerge. .X 33	1	314 48	1	314 89	1	314 100	1	314 102	2	314 105	1	314 106	3	314 108	1	314 110	1	314 113	2	314 155	1	314 157	1	314 314	7	314 356	1	314 359	1	314 544	1	314 545	1	314 560	1	314 573	1	314 582	1	314 587	1	314 605	1	314 656	1	314 685	1	314 748	1	314 750	1	314 767	2	314 775	1	314 778	1	314 787	1	314 791	1	314 793	1	314 794	1	314 800	2	314 808	1	314 1030	1	314 1050	1	314 1062	1	314 1256	1	314 1273	1	314 1274	1	314 1284	1	314 1285	4	314 1290	1	314 1291	1	314 1293	1	314 1294	1	314 1295	1	314 1296	1	314 1297	1	314 1312	1	314 1313	1	314 1319	1	314 1337	1	314 1338	1	314 1346	1	314 1352	1	314 1386	2	314 1386	2	314
