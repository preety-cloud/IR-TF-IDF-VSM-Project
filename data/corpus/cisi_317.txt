Natural Language Question - Answering System: 1969 .A Simmons, Robert F. Recent experiments in programming natural language question-answering system are reviewed to summarize the methods that have been developed for syntactic, semantic, and logical analysis of English strings.. It is concluded that at least minimally effective  techniques have been devised for answering questions from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field.. Current approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subset of English.. Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language processing systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries - with correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems - may entail a new order of complexity and require the invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and question answering.. .X 77	1	317 79	1	317 168	5	317 175	1	317 179	1	317 317	6	317 320	2	317 332	1	317 388	1	317 417	1	317 443	1	317 488	1	317 489	1	317 493	1	317 498	1	317 499	1	317 546	1	317 558	1	317 570	1	317 572	2	317 581	1	317 608	1	317 659	1	317 790	1	317 902	1	317 1046	2	317 1118	1	317 1137	1	317 1294	1	317 1327	1	317 1399	3	317 1413	1	317 1443	2	317 1448	1	317 1448	1	317
