Inefficiency of the Use of Boolean Functions for Information Retrieval Systems .A Verhoeff, J. Goffman, W. Belzer, J. In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval systems. First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it.  This situation is, of course, well known. Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory.  However, these should be relatively few.  In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question. So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list.  Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question.  More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set. .X 54	2	319 70	1	319 72	1	319 73	2	319 150	1	319 319	5	319 390	1	319 444	1	319 474	1	319 487	1	319 509	1	319 519	1	319 565	1	319 625	1	319 660	2	319 714	1	319 780	2	319 785	2	319 810	2	319 1279	1	319 1282	1	319 1307	1	319 1427	1	319 1427	1	319
