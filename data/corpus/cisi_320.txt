The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language .A Quillian, M.R. The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to "comprehend" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a "semantic network" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. .X 61	1	320 77	1	320 79	1	320 117	1	320 168	2	320 175	1	320 274	1	320 317	2	320 320	6	320 458	1	320 459	1	320 488	1	320 489	1	320 493	1	320 498	1	320 499	1	320 526	1	320 546	1	320 558	1	320 570	1	320 572	1	320 579	1	320 581	1	320 590	1	320 606	1	320 626	1	320 659	1	320 664	1	320 754	1	320 790	1	320 814	1	320 826	1	320 1035	1	320 1046	2	320 1118	1	320 1294	1	320 1399	1	320 1427	1	320 1443	3	320 1443	3	320
