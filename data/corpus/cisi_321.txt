An Information-Theoretic Approach to Text Searching in Direct Access Systems .A Barton, I.J. Creasey, S.E. Lynch, M.F. Snell, M.J. Using direct access computer files of bibliographic information, an attempt is made to overcome one of the problems often associated with information retrieval, namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only infrequently. A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to implementation on storage devices. This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.  The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages. .K text searching, information theory, filed organization, direct access, information retrieval, character string, bit vector .C 3.42 3.70 3.73 3.74 5.6 .X 19	2	321 228	3	321 229	1	321 318	1	321 321	6	321 324	1	321 329	2	321 416	2	321 419	1	321 442	2	321 450	2	321 459	1	321 495	1	321 511	2	321 521	1	321 524	2	321 562	1	321 563	1	321 565	1	321 567	1	321 643	1	321 660	1	321 700	1	321 835	2	321 851	2	321 862	2	321 867	1	321 875	1	321 1194	2	321 1199	3	321 1218	1	321 1327	1	321 1427	1	321 1427	1	321
