Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English .A Kucera, H. Readers can expect to find many parts of this volume tantalizing.  The definiteness of the answers to certain questions irresistibly provokes more questions.  The happy feature is that the book provides information required to limit the effect to that of tantalizing rather than frustrating. For there is given here a wholly adequate description of the nature of the Corpus of Present-Day Edited American English on which this study is based, the details of its constituents, and the modes of its transfer to tape.  A replica of that tape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the cost in time needed to produce a like corpus.  Accordingly, any reader who seriously wants answers to further questions can set about getting those answers. .X 19	1	324 27	1	324 69	1	324 79	1	324 168	2	324 174	1	324 175	1	324 226	1	324 228	1	324 316	1	324 318	1	324 321	1	324 324	15	324 329	1	324 416	2	324 420	1	324 441	2	324 442	2	324 450	1	324 479	1	324 489	1	324 495	1	324 499	1	324 511	2	324 524	1	324 558	1	324 563	1	324 565	1	324 566	1	324 567	1	324 571	1	324 657	1	324 666	1	324 755	1	324 835	1	324 851	1	324 856	1	324 862	1	324 875	1	324 1084	1	324 1144	1	324 1194	1	324 1199	1	324 1265	1	324 1309	1	324 1394	1	324 1395	1	324 1419	1	324 1419	1	324
