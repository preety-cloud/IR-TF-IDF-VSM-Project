Computer Filing of Index Bibliographic and Catalog Entries .A Hines, T.C. The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement has become increasingly apparent as more and more book catalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Many of the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rules for Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to cope with when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not an object, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are practically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedures can make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog, or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, and these modifications are made in this proposed code for computer filing of complex alphabetic entries. .X 39	1	326 50	1	326 92	1	326 209	1	326 235	1	326 246	1	326 247	1	326 276	1	326 326	7	326 333	1	326 446	1	326 473	1	326 485	1	326 503	1	326 572	1	326 616	1	326 632	1	326 746	1	326 773	1	326 848	1	326 874	1	326 880	1	326 922	1	326 928	1	326 950	1	326 958	1	326 963	1	326 973	1	326 991	1	326 997	1	326 1000	1	326 1153	1	326 1207	1	326 1216	1	326 1266	1	326 1283	1	326 1395	1	326 1426	1	326 1441	1	326 1441	1	326
