Computer Handling of Chemical Structure Information .A Lynch, M.F. Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science are at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental effects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge. These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific and technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes are not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access. But the changes to be effected also have major social implications; the reasons for publication and use of information are complex, reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods. .X 116	1	327 117	1	327 175	1	327 176	1	327 254	3	327 327	11	327 389	1	327 509	1	327 568	3	327 569	2	327 619	1	327 641	1	327 668	1	327 670	1	327 671	3	327 673	1	327 677	1	327 678	1	327 679	1	327 682	1	327 689	1	327 690	1	327 692	1	327 693	1	327 694	1	327 695	2	327 698	2	327 700	1	327 704	1	327 706	3	327 707	1	327 730	1	327 738	1	327 817	1	327 833	1	327 890	3	327 1026	1	327 1044	1	327 1072	1	327 1092	3	327 1218	1	327 1292	2	327 1452	2	327 1452	2	327
