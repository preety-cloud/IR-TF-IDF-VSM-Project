The identification of variable-length, equifrequent character strings in a natural language data base .A Clare, A.C. Cook, Elizabeth M. Lynch, M.F. The words of natural language texts exhibit a Poisson (or Zipfian) rank- frequency relationship, i.e., a small number of common words accounts for a large proportion of word occurrences, while a large number of the words occur as singletons or only infrequently.. Inverted-file retrieval systems using free text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization of storage because of the distribution characteristics.. An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in dictionary look-up times and storage utilization. .X 19	2	329 44	1	329 57	2	329 75	1	329 176	1	329 228	3	329 229	1	329 318	2	329 321	2	329 324	1	329 329	11	329 346	1	329 359	1	329 416	4	329 442	5	329 450	4	329 495	3	329 511	6	329 521	2	329 524	2	329 536	1	329 563	1	329 565	4	329 567	3	329 572	1	329 595	1	329 596	1	329 608	1	329 619	1	329 700	2	329 791	3	329 810	1	329 812	1	329 813	1	329 814	1	329 835	1	329 851	1	329 862	1	329 867	1	329 870	1	329 872	1	329 875	3	329 894	2	329 928	1	329 963	1	329 990	1	329 991	1	329 1194	2	329 1196	1	329 1199	3	329 1255	1	329 1362	1	329 1396	1	329 1398	1	329 1413	1	329 1445	1	329 1445	1	329
