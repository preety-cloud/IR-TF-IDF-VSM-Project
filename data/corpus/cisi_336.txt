Conceptual Design of an Automated National Library System .A Meise, N.R. This work describes a conceptual design of an automated national library system.  The design is "conceptual" in that it is intended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather than provide a detailed engineering design.  The design concerns an automated national library system but does not attempt to automate all parts of the system.  It is primarily concerned with the functions of bibliographic searching, acquisition, circulation, and cataloging.  If these functions can be economically automated, the major problems associated with our information explosion will be solved. .X 24	2	336 74	1	336 75	2	336 78	1	336 80	1	336 119	1	336 122	1	336 175	1	336 177	1	336 273	1	336 281	1	336 331	1	336 336	6	336 654	1	336 684	1	336 852	1	336 853	1	336 854	1	336 855	2	336 856	1	336 925	1	336 955	1	336 984	1	336 1011	3	336 1080	1	336 1144	1	336 1451	1	336 1451	1	336
