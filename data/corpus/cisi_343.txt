A Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge .A Kuhn, T.J. On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems, Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean. .X 100	1	343 101	2	343 102	1	343 343	13	343 391	1	343 417	1	343 438	1	343 514	1	343 546	1	343 606	1	343 610	1	343 611	1	343 612	1	343 626	1	343 1063	1	343 1187	1	343 1271	3	343 1272	2	343 1289	1	343 1296	1	343 1310	2	343 1311	2	343 1314	1	343 1339	1	343 1340	1	343 1345	1	343 1386	4	343 1387	2	343 1387	2	343
