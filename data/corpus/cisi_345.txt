Data Bases; Computers, and the Social Sciences .A Bisco, R.L. This book was written with several diverse audiences in mind: (1) social and behavioral scientists and their students, (2) librarians and library-science students who are favorable about employing computers and computer-usable information in their work and classes, and (3) archivists and their employees who desire to have more than a current overview of the problems and their tentative solutions.  Because of the diversity of material, it is not expected that all readers will use the book in the same way.  Rather, it is assumed that readers will supplement a subset of the book with bibliographical materials from the reference sections. .X 114	1	345 169	1	345 289	1	345 345	7	345 400	1	345 456	1	345 459	1	345 493	1	345 548	1	345 607	1	345 627	1	345 803	1	345 990	1	345 1031	1	345 1073	1	345 1328	2	345 1368	1	345 1392	1	345 1414	1	345 1448	1	345 1448	1	345
