Data Study .A Jolley, J.L. Information, whose handling is the topic of this book, is generated by change, and whatever is our unit of change is our unit of information.  In a situation in which only three possible moves can be made, only three fundamental units of information can be found, no matter how complex a structure we may build upon them.  Our topic is therefore a special sort of change, the change brought about in acquiring or keeping or transmitting elements of knowledge. .X 29	1	346 68	1	346 69	1	346 148	2	346 175	1	346 261	1	346 329	1	346 346	7	346 382	1	346 458	1	346 476	1	346 477	1	346 478	1	346 479	1	346 480	1	346 484	1	346 485	1	346 566	1	346 680	1	346 704	1	346 781	1	346 802	1	346 1053	1	346 1118	1	346 1175	1	346 1309	1	346 1309	1	346
