A Regional Network - Ohio college Library Center .A Kilgour, F.G. The Ohio College Library Center is developing a computerized, user-oriented, library system that will improve efficiency of library use and operations; that will increase availability of library resources within a region; and that will facilitate evolution of new and easier accesses to information in libraries.  The center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past. For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future. The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general economy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole. .X 63	1	348 90	1	348 159	1	348 175	1	348 177	1	348 214	1	348 218	1	348 250	1	348 287	2	348 340	1	348 348	11	348 375	1	348 389	1	348 390	1	348 406	1	348 408	2	348 487	1	348 502	1	348 546	1	348 554	1	348 579	1	348 582	1	348 583	1	348 584	1	348 585	1	348 596	1	348 600	1	348 601	1	348 654	1	348 655	1	348 797	1	348 798	1	348 799	2	348 805	1	348 807	1	348 834	1	348 849	1	348 851	1	348 855	1	348 856	1	348 857	1	348 858	2	348 859	3	348 860	1	348 861	2	348 862	1	348 863	1	348 864	1	348 868	1	348 872	1	348 897	1	348 916	1	348 954	1	348 956	1	348 963	1	348 979	1	348 986	1	348 987	1	348 988	1	348 989	1	348 1007	1	348 1012	2	348 1013	1	348 1035	1	348 1152	1	348 1188	1	348 1196	1	348 1197	1	348 1265	1	348 1294	1	348 1327	1	348 1333	1	348 1362	1	348 1363	1	348 1366	1	348 1379	1	348 1445	1	348 1445	1	348
