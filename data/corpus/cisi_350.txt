The Design of Inquiring Systems .A Churchman, C.W. "Design" is used throughout in its most generic sense, to include planning, operations research, engineering design, architectural design, programming, budgeting, and all the other activities in which we consciously attempt to change ourselves and our environment to improve the quality of our lives.  So the book could be read as a philosophy of organization theory, or of architectural or engineering design, or of operations research, or of planning. The word "inquiry" suggests that the audience includes persons interested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as the interest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science with respect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and so on.  Inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science.  I could have called the book The Design of Systems, but this would not adequately reflect my style, which is to proceed from the more specific problem of inquiry to the "whole system." .X 66	1	350 245	1	350 249	1	350 331	1	350 350	5	350 401	1	350 435	1	350 455	1	350 621	1	350 925	1	350 963	1	350 1270	1	350 1400	1	350 1402	1	350 1456	1	350 1456	1	350
