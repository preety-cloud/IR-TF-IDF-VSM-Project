Dewey Decimal Classification .A Dewey, M. The schedules of Edition 18, like those of 17, are based on the principle of subject integrity.  Both the subject matter and the notation are hierarchical, so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts. The schedules are developed according to logical principles, so that the classifier is guided to make correct decisions.  The terminology of the classification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literature being classified. For ease of use, this edition includes many more example notes, more detailed and precise instructions, and freer use of layman's terminology than did its immediate predecessor. Since this edition is intended for use as a shelf-arrangement system for general libraries of all sizes, its fulness is based upon the number of titles that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields.  Since it is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies (for which the Dewey Decimal Classification is increasingly in demand in many countries), it contains an increased number of provisions for number building. .X 90	1	354 231	1	354 261	2	354 295	1	354 299	1	354 334	1	354 354	6	354 404	1	354 608	1	354 610	1	354 617	1	354 620	1	354 815	1	354 874	1	354 884	1	354 887	1	354 892	1	354 938	1	354 939	1	354 991	1	354 992	2	354 998	1	354 1221	1	354 1318	1	354 1351	1	354 1365	1	354 1390	1	354 1395	1	354 1395	1	354
