Diffusion of Innovations .A Rogers, E. This book is directed both to advanced college students enrolled in sociology courses and to students of the other social sciences (such as anthropology, economics, history, and psychology) who are concerned with diffusion.  (For this reason, sociological concepts are defined when they are introduced.) More than five hundred publications on the diffusion of innovations are reviewed here.  The innovations studied range from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive tribes, and from driver training among public high schools to hybrid corn among farmers.  Although a generally consistent set of findings has emerged from these studies, a search of the literature shows little attempt to summarize and evaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas. This volume synthesizes these findings and theories. .X 15	1	356 89	2	356 102	1	356 105	3	356 110	1	356 111	1	356 113	2	356 139	1	356 147	1	356 155	1	356 157	1	356 161	1	356 163	1	356 243	1	356 312	3	356 314	1	356 356	11	356 391	1	356 426	1	356 436	3	356 437	2	356 475	1	356 544	2	356 545	1	356 560	3	356 582	1	356 592	1	356 602	1	356 607	1	356 656	1	356 658	1	356 685	1	356 1030	2	356 1036	1	356 1041	1	356 1050	3	356 1062	1	356 1154	1	356 1186	1	356 1187	2	356 1256	1	356 1284	1	356 1285	1	356 1288	1	356 1290	1	356 1291	2	356 1293	2	356 1294	1	356 1295	1	356 1296	2	356 1297	1	356 1298	1	356 1300	1	356 1319	1	356 1321	1	356 1333	2	356 1346	3	356 1347	1	356 1386	2	356 1406	1	356 1407	1	356 1407	1	356
