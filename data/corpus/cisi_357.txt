Directory of Data Base in the Social and Behavioral Sciences .A Sessions, V.S. As one of the early members of the computer community, I have been keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologies in the social and behavioral sciences, and their encouragement by the data processing environment.  The economists, with an already established mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiaries of the machine technology that enhances their ability to construct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statistical methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at The City University of New York and at other universities. The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic supplies of data, is not to reinventory the social science data archives that are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate the announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their members.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those researchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficiently aware of these important resources. .X 18	1	357 127	1	357 130	1	357 145	1	357 357	6	357 376	1	357 459	2	357 524	1	357 525	1	357 527	1	357 529	1	357 530	1	357 534	1	357 611	1	357 612	1	357 633	1	357 635	1	357 636	1	357 637	1	357 642	1	357 702	1	357 703	1	357 710	1	357 730	1	357 732	1	357 733	1	357 734	1	357 736	1	357 826	1	357 827	1	357 877	1	357 879	2	357 993	2	357 1370	1	357 1372	1	357 1383	1	357 1396	2	357 1396	2	357
