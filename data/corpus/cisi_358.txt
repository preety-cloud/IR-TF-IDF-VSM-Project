The Disadvantaged and Library Effectiveness .A Lipsman, c.K. The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective programs.  In the absence of established standards or criteria for measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process; a survey of needs and interests of the target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move. To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities. In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or effectiveness of the program. .X 9	1	358 10	1	358 161	1	358 190	1	358 207	1	358 208	1	358 222	1	358 223	1	358 225	1	358 232	1	358 239	2	358 241	1	358 244	1	358 295	1	358 296	1	358 297	1	358 298	1	358 300	2	358 301	1	358 302	1	358 304	1	358 305	1	358 306	1	358 331	1	358 358	16	358 364	1	358 385	2	358 394	1	358 406	1	358 433	2	358 459	1	358 515	1	358 534	1	358 535	1	358 624	1	358 625	1	358 629	1	358 631	2	358 634	1	358 702	1	358 731	1	358 732	1	358 791	1	358 811	1	358 816	1	358 817	1	358 818	1	358 820	1	358 823	2	358 825	1	358 826	1	358 827	1	358 828	1	358 843	1	358 844	1	358 846	1	358 896	1	358 908	1	358 915	1	358 937	2	358 946	5	358 947	1	358 948	2	358 961	1	358 962	1	358 964	1	358 994	1	358 1005	4	358 1015	1	358 1017	1	358 1018	2	358 1032	1	358 1033	1	358 1056	4	358 1058	1	358 1079	1	358 1145	2	358 1146	1	358 1227	1	358 1230	1	358 1240	2	358 1242	1	358 1247	1	358 1257	1	358 1268	1	358 1354	1	358 1373	1	358 1379	1	358 1384	1	358 1390	1	358 1403	1	358 1403	1	358
