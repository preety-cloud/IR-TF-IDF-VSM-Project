Documentation .A Bradford, S.C. .B 1948 More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started their lives' work, which at first was connected with the term "bibliography," but to which gradually the work "Documentation" was attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scope than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed and non-printed documents. The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked side by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a common treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension and to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill of all nations. It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men, whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives. And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but added to it fundamental and constructive new elements. Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on documentation available.  But his book gives us before all things an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts. .X 19	1	359 31	1	359 36	1	359 37	1	359 39	1	359 40	1	359 41	1	359 44	2	359 47	1	359 55	1	359 57	2	359 62	3	359 76	1	359 81	1	359 88	1	359 89	1	359 97	1	359 98	1	359 100	1	359 102	1	359 103	1	359 107	1	359 111	1	359 131	2	359 133	1	359 136	1	359 138	1	359 140	1	359 149	1	359 162	1	359 167	1	359 175	1	359 184	1	359 189	1	359 193	1	359 195	1	359 196	1	359 201	2	359 203	1	359 204	1	359 205	1	359 210	1	359 215	1	359 219	1	359 221	2	359 228	1	359 229	1	359 233	2	359 253	1	359 255	1	359 267	1	359 313	1	359 314	1	359 329	1	359 359	33	359 373	1	359 377	1	359 378	1	359 379	2	359 382	1	359 395	2	359 415	1	359 416	3	359 475	1	359 487	1	359 494	1	359 505	3	359 511	1	359 515	1	359 560	1	359 573	4	359 587	2	359 602	1	359 616	1	359 618	2	359 625	1	359 632	1	359 634	1	359 635	2	359 667	2	359 700	1	359 744	1	359 748	10	359 749	1	359 750	2	359 751	7	359 756	1	359 759	5	359 764	1	359 765	9	359 767	3	359 775	1	359 776	1	359 777	1	359 778	12	359 782	1	359 787	5	359 788	1	359 791	6	359 792	2	359 793	1	359 800	2	359 804	3	359 805	1	359 872	1	359 893	5	359 905	1	359 915	1	359 925	1	359 952	2	359 961	1	359 1016	5	359 1019	1	359 1030	1	359 1055	1	359 1061	1	359 1062	1	359 1071	2	359 1076	1	359 1081	2	359 1082	2	359 1083	8	359 1084	1	359 1085	13	359 1086	8	359 1087	2	359 1090	3	359 1097	1	359 1098	1	359 1114	1	359 1122	1	359 1147	1	359 1157	1	359 1173	3	359 1182	5	359 1196	1	359 1200	1	359 1201	3	359 1203	1	359 1226	1	359 1274	1	359 1275	1	359 1277	1	359 1278	2	359 1280	1	359 1282	1	359 1285	1	359 1287	1	359 1291	1	359 1296	1	359 1301	2	359 1302	7	359 1304	1	359 1313	1	359 1317	1	359 1338	1	359 1344	1	359 1347	1	359 1352	1	359 1380	1	359 1401	1	359 1417	1	359 1418	1	359 1428	1	359 1444	1	359 1444	1	359
