Documentation .A Bradford, S.C. .B 1953 Since the first publication of this work Dr. Bradford has died, and, a further edition now being called for, an attempt has been made to recognize if not to deal with some criticisms expressed on the first edition. The principal one was that whereas the book was entitled "Documentation" it dealt in the main with the Universal Decimal Classification, which Bradford did much to develop, but that it neglected other aspects and instruments of the subject of which the UDC is only one, even if an important one, of various techniques. .X 3	1	361 33	1	361 48	1	361 55	1	361 79	1	361 198	1	361 234	1	361 361	12	361 382	1	361 457	1	361 545	1	361 608	1	361 616	1	361 632	1	361 635	1	361 665	1	361 751	1	361 759	3	361 765	1	361 775	1	361 776	1	361 789	1	361 792	1	361 803	1	361 825	1	361 872	1	361 911	1	361 939	1	361 940	1	361 941	1	361 966	1	361 996	1	361 997	1	361 1080	1	361 1085	1	361 1170	2	361 1173	1	361 1216	1	361 1266	1	361 1275	2	361 1302	1	361 1309	1	361 1381	1	361 1395	1	361 1421	1	361 1432	1	361 1435	1	361 1436	1	361 1441	1	361 1441	1	361
