Economic Analysis of the Public Libraries .A Newhouse, J.P. This study addresses itself to several questions important to all public libraries.  How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds of books should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Why do some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various services provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an investment in a security system worthwhile? We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose during our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library, our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public libraries. .X 4	1	364 5	2	364 9	1	364 115	1	364 207	2	364 217	1	364 222	1	364 223	1	364 234	1	364 243	1	364 245	2	364 249	1	364 296	1	364 297	1	364 298	1	364 300	1	364 301	1	364 302	1	364 358	1	364 364	6	364 365	1	364 385	1	364 470	1	364 515	1	364 535	1	364 598	1	364 625	1	364 629	1	364 631	1	364 634	1	364 764	1	364 766	1	364 779	1	364 791	1	364 811	3	364 816	3	364 818	2	364 823	2	364 842	1	364 843	1	364 844	1	364 846	1	364 915	1	364 925	2	364 944	1	364 948	1	364 959	1	364 960	1	364 961	2	364 962	2	364 964	2	364 994	1	364 1008	1	364 1015	1	364 1023	1	364 1242	1	364 1247	1	364 1257	1	364 1263	1	364 1268	1	364 1353	1	364 1354	1	364 1400	1	364 1403	1	364 1403	1	364
