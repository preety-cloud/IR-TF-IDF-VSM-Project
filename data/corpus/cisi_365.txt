Economics of the Academic Libraries .A Baumol, W.J. This volume represents what we believe to be as complete and thorough an analysis as possible of the available economic data on college and university libraries.  In the course of our study, we have examined the data for comprehensiveness and consistency; we have investigated their intertemporal behavior, both as a basis for projection and as an instrument for long-range planning; and we have constructed a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most critical economic variables relating to library operations.  In particular, in the course of this last step, we have provided relationships explaining statistically the determination of such variables as the size of libraries' budgets and the magnitude of their professional staffs. .X 5	1	365 115	1	365 119	1	365 122	1	365 141	1	365 172	1	365 234	1	365 244	1	365 245	1	365 249	1	365 250	1	365 262	1	365 299	1	365 353	1	365 364	1	365 365	10	365 394	1	365 408	1	365 453	2	365 526	1	365 528	1	365 529	1	365 612	1	365 630	1	365 652	1	365 764	1	365 811	1	365 816	1	365 818	1	365 822	1	365 823	1	365 825	1	365 842	1	365 854	1	365 856	1	365 871	1	365 872	2	365 873	1	365 874	1	365 875	1	365 876	1	365 877	1	365 878	1	365 879	1	365 880	1	365 886	1	365 888	1	365 892	1	365 913	1	365 925	1	365 938	1	365 940	2	365 941	1	365 943	1	365 944	1	365 948	1	365 963	1	365 974	1	365 984	1	365 990	1	365 994	1	365 997	1	365 998	1	365 1004	1	365 1023	1	365 1068	1	365 1079	1	365 1143	2	365 1203	1	365 1211	1	365 1212	1	365 1230	1	365 1247	1	365 1257	3	365 1258	1	365 1264	1	365 1266	1	365 1303	1	365 1317	1	365 1367	1	365 1396	1	365 1425	1	365 1433	1	365 1435	2	365 1436	2	365 1441	1	365 1441	1	365
