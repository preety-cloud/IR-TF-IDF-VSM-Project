Economies and Computers .A Sharpe, W.F. It is not a simple matter to describe this book.  Briefly, it attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision- makers in the selection, financing, and/or use of computers.  Only theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This means that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal, thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national product, consumer price index, unemployment). .X 5	1	368 90	1	368 91	1	368 158	1	368 222	1	368 223	1	368 368	5	368 435	1	368 615	1	368 815	1	368 957	1	368 1023	1	368 1219	1	368 1227	1	368 1365	1	368 1390	1	368 1390	1	368
