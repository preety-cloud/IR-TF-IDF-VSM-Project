Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age .A Hitch, C.J. The purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions.  Essentially we regard all military problems as, in one of their aspects, economic problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources.  We believe that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are responsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primary interest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of the military budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable. .X 83	1	369 273	1	369 369	5	369 382	1	369 717	1	369 1151	1	369 1227	1	369 1406	1	369 1449	1	369 1449	1	369
