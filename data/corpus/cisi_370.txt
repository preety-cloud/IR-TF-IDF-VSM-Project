Educating the Library User .A Lubans, J. Educating the Library User is a collection of original essays, case studies, and research reports on the problems, hopes, and techniques of instructing library users and nonusers, from the kindergartener to the preschool adult, in the effective use of libraries and their resources. Merging the library-use teachings of school, public, and academic libraries, this book demonstrates the need for a consistent, sequential plan of library-use instruction that crosses traditional library boundaries. .X 128	1	370 130	1	370 191	1	370 274	1	370 339	1	370 370	11	370 376	1	370 387	1	370 453	1	370 629	1	370 648	2	370 652	1	370 768	1	370 774	1	370 818	2	370 839	1	370 847	3	370 1068	1	370 1246	2	370 1263	1	370 1376	1	370 1403	1	370 1457	1	370 1457	1	370
