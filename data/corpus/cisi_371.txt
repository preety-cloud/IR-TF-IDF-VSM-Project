Education and Training for Scientific and Technological Library and Information Work .A Schur, M. The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years. It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology). There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at a very high level indeed. .X 2	1	371 22	1	371 60	1	371 150	1	371 243	1	371 272	1	371 339	1	371 347	1	371 371	13	371 382	1	371 387	1	371 465	1	371 466	1	371 475	1	371 480	2	371 658	1	371 681	1	371 682	1	371 704	1	371 716	1	371 717	1	371 760	1	371 770	1	371 776	1	371 839	1	371 844	1	371 923	1	371 924	1	371 967	1	371 1403	1	371 1404	1	371 1404	1	371
