Some User Requirements Stated Quantitatively in Terms of the 90 Percent Library .A Bourne, C.P. Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge. .X 31	1	373 33	2	373 36	1	373 41	1	373 89	1	373 97	1	373 102	1	373 111	1	373 112	1	373 163	1	373 183	1	373 184	1	373 193	1	373 199	1	373 201	3	373 203	3	373 210	1	373 225	1	373 269	1	373 359	1	373 373	6	373 379	1	373 475	1	373 545	1	373 552	1	373 587	1	373 605	1	373 613	1	373 614	1	373 638	1	373 735	1	373 747	1	373 748	1	373 750	1	373 753	1	373 766	1	373 767	1	373 775	2	373 782	1	373 784	1	373 788	1	373 789	1	373 793	1	373 800	1	373 808	1	373 889	1	373 905	1	373 953	1	373 977	3	373 983	1	373 1016	1	373 1019	1	373 1023	1	373 1030	1	373 1055	1	373 1087	1	373 1090	1	373 1135	1	373 1173	1	373 1203	2	373 1256	1	373 1260	1	373 1275	1	373 1276	1	373 1278	1	373 1280	1	373 1285	1	373 1286	1	373 1287	1	373 1302	1	373 1335	1	373 1352	1	373 1390	1	373 1397	2	373 1417	1	373 1428	1	373 1432	1	373 1432	1	373
