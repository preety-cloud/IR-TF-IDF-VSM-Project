Electronic Data Processing in the University Library .A Pflug, G. Following five years of experience with the mechanization of procedures using data processing equipment, the university library in Bochum is attempting to summarize its findings. A comparison with earlier publications about the use of electronic data processing equipment shows in what measure the original plans have actually been affected by the experience that has been gained.  This summary also serves as a report for the wider public that may be interested in technical questions of library processing. .X 64	1	374 164	1	374 172	1	374 175	1	374 177	1	374 178	1	374 245	1	374 374	5	374 408	1	374 419	1	374 458	1	374 471	1	374 481	1	374 491	1	374 507	1	374 520	1	374 523	1	374 623	1	374 717	1	374 781	1	374 783	1	374 822	1	374 834	1	374 835	1	374 848	1	374 849	1	374 850	1	374 851	1	374 852	1	374 907	1	374 922	1	374 925	1	374 981	1	374 982	1	374 1042	1	374 1051	1	374 1248	1	374 1327	1	374 1415	1	374 1415	1	374
