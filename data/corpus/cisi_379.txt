Sources of Information on Specific Subjects .A Bradford, S.C. An alternative hypothesis to be investigated is that, to a considerable extent, the references are scattered throughout all periodicals with a frequency approximately related inversely to the scope.  On this hypothesis, the aggregate of periodicals can be divided into classes according to relevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the more remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce as many references as the more related classes.  The whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of successive generations of diminishing kinship, each generation being greater in number than the preceding, and each constituent of a generation producing inversely according to its degree of remoteness. The investigation covered, in the first place, the references quoted, in the course of four and two and a-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies of Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are prepared in the library.  The source of each reference being given, it was possible to arrange the sources in order of productivity, the results being set down in columns A and B of the table, in the previous column. .X 19	1	379 31	1	379 37	1	379 39	2	379 40	1	379 47	1	379 55	1	379 88	1	379 97	2	379 102	1	379 103	1	379 198	1	379 201	1	379 233	2	379 253	1	379 313	1	379 359	2	379 373	1	379 377	1	379 379	11	379 395	2	379 475	1	379 505	1	379 560	1	379 573	1	379 588	1	379 616	1	379 618	2	379 632	1	379 635	1	379 667	1	379 685	1	379 735	1	379 748	5	379 749	2	379 751	1	379 764	1	379 765	2	379 775	1	379 777	1	379 778	4	379 782	1	379 791	1	379 804	1	379 805	1	379 821	1	379 889	2	379 893	2	379 952	1	379 1016	1	379 1019	1	379 1030	1	379 1061	1	379 1083	1	379 1085	3	379 1086	2	379 1087	2	379 1173	1	379 1182	2	379 1200	1	379 1201	1	379 1203	1	379 1274	1	379 1275	2	379 1277	1	379 1278	1	379 1280	1	379 1285	1	379 1287	1	379 1290	1	379 1301	1	379 1302	3	379 1304	1	379 1313	1	379 1338	1	379 1344	1	379 1347	1	379 1355	1	379 1380	4	379 1418	1	379 1428	1	379 1444	1	379 1444	1	379
