Evaluation of Micropublishing .A Veaner, A.B Micropublishing, as it pertains to library materials, is essentially a form of the republishing of materials no longer in print.  The need for such materials of many kinds - monographs, serials, newspapers, reference works - has grown greatly during the past quarter century and this need is reflected in the growth of the micropublishing industry.  As new colleges and junior colleges are founded, and established colleges and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs, both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the materials they need are available only in microform.  As a result, the ratio of microforms to books in college and research libraries has been steadily rising. .X 231	1	383 286	1	383 352	1	383 383	9	383 911	1	383 1014	2	383 1058	1	383 1059	1	383 1152	1	383 1268	1	383 1268	1	383
