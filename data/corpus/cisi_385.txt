Evaluative Research Principles and Practice in Public Service and Social Action Programs .A Suchman, E.A. In these days of large government programs intended to reduce poverty, develop communities, prevent delinquency and crime, control disease, and reconstruct cities, the predominant rhetoric is that of planning, pilot projects, experimental and demonstration programs - and evaluation.  Those who seek to select for support the more promising plans and projects submitted to funding agencies have become habituated to the ritualistic inclusion in the proposal of a final section on Evaluation.  In most cases this section consists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent and procedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action.  In some cases there is an elegant, highly academic, and impractical scheme worked out in meticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant.  In a few treasured instances there is a well-considered, realistic, and workmanlike plan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what worked and why. .X 10	1	385 190	1	385 208	1	385 217	1	385 225	1	385 243	1	385 244	1	385 249	1	385 304	1	385 305	1	385 306	1	385 358	2	385 364	1	385 385	7	385 394	1	385 433	1	385 459	1	385 534	1	385 598	1	385 702	1	385 731	1	385 732	1	385 779	1	385 817	1	385 820	1	385 823	1	385 825	1	385 826	1	385 827	1	385 828	1	385 947	1	385 948	1	385 1005	1	385 1017	1	385 1018	1	385 1056	1	385 1058	1	385 1146	1	385 1230	1	385 1257	1	385 1384	1	385 1390	1	385 1403	1	385 1403	1	385
