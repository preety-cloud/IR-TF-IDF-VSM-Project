Informal Communication in Science: Its Advantages and its Formal Analogues .A Menzel, H. Formal and informal scientific communication are complementary; they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that, perhaps, certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printed word, the library, and the mechanized search-and-retrieval system, whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of word-of-mouth and the telephone.  The much more typical event is one in which the receipt of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two kinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientist as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen again with similar results. .X 24	1	386 58	1	386 62	1	386 65	1	386 66	1	386 75	1	386 76	1	386 95	2	386 98	1	386 100	1	386 105	1	386 107	1	386 109	1	386 137	1	386 163	1	386 172	1	386 210	1	386 278	1	386 279	1	386 280	1	386 386	6	386 395	1	386 398	4	386 544	2	386 560	1	386 578	1	386 658	1	386 716	1	386 748	1	386 782	1	386 788	1	386 789	1	386 837	1	386 925	1	386 1063	1	386 1083	1	386 1142	1	386 1270	1	386 1284	2	386 1300	2	386 1312	1	386 1313	1	386 1345	1	386 1361	1	386 1386	1	386 1400	1	386 1404	1	386 1408	1	386 1446	1	386 1447	1	386 1447	1	386
