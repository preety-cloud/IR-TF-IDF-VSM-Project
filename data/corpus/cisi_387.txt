The Foundations of Education for Librarianship .A Shera, J.H. The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and administration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at Western Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which has been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed. My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the communication system within the individual as related to his physiological, neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society, together with the place of the library in it. .X 128	1	387 130	1	387 171	1	387 173	1	387 191	1	387 230	1	387 339	3	387 370	1	387 371	1	387 376	1	387 387	5	387 453	1	387 470	1	387 629	1	387 648	1	387 652	1	387 923	1	387 924	1	387 1376	1	387 1403	3	387 1423	2	387 1457	1	387 1457	1	387
