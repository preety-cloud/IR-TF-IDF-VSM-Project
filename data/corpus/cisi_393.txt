Farewell to Alexandria Solution to space, growth, and performance problems of libraries .A Gore, D. The publication of this collection of essays opens a new era for libraries, taking the first departure in 2,300 years from that durable model conceived by the librarians of Alexandria and endlessly replicated by every succeeding generation of librarians, right down to the present day.  The Alexandrian model persists through the unexamined faith that to be good a library must be vast and always growing.  The papers presented here examine that faith scientifically, demonstrate that it rests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition, and consign it to the limbo of outworn dogmas. .X 115	1	393 128	1	393 129	1	393 130	1	393 167	1	393 223	1	393 225	1	393 234	1	393 280	1	393 393	8	393 468	1	393 494	1	393 639	1	393 646	1	393 647	2	393 651	2	393 757	1	393 765	1	393 818	1	393 822	1	393 823	1	393 827	1	393 831	1	393 925	1	393 943	1	393 944	1	393 947	1	393 1059	1	393 1060	1	393 1070	1	393 1085	1	393 1374	1	393 1390	1	393 1401	1	393 1437	1	393 1437	1	393
