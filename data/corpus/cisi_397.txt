Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata .A Hopcroft, J.E. This book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory and makes explicit its relationship to automata.  The book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability. .X 396	1	397 397	11	397 417	3	397 430	3	397 443	3	397 455	4	397 464	3	397 745	3	397 1204	3	397 1398	3	397 1427	3	397 1427	3	397
