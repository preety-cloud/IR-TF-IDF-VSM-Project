Informal Channels of Communication In the Behavioral Sciences: Their Relevance In the Structuring of Formal or Bibliographic Communication .A Garvey, W.D. Griffith, B.C. What are the needs being served by informal communication? What can be done about giving informal communication, without destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of the advantages of formal communication, such as, general accessibility, permanence, etc.?  How can formal channels be manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal communication?  To cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology, considers the special advantages of informal communication, and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments in scientific communication are described; one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to "informalize" formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that, in general, attempts to "formalize" an informal channel.  .X 24	1	398 62	1	398 65	1	398 66	1	398 75	1	398 76	1	398 95	1	398 98	1	398 105	1	398 109	1	398 137	1	398 162	1	398 163	1	398 210	1	398 278	1	398 279	1	398 280	1	398 386	4	398 395	1	398 398	5	398 544	1	398 560	1	398 658	1	398 716	1	398 748	1	398 782	1	398 788	1	398 789	1	398 837	1	398 925	1	398 933	1	398 1063	1	398 1076	1	398 1083	1	398 1142	1	398 1270	1	398 1284	2	398 1300	1	398 1361	1	398 1400	1	398 1404	1	398 1408	1	398 1446	1	398 1447	1	398 1447	1	398
