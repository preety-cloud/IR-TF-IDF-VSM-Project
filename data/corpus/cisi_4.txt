Systems Analysis of a University Library; final report and research project .A Buckland, M.K. The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university. The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision. .X 4	10	4 5	2	4 9	1	4 32	1	4 65	1	4 96	1	4 137	1	4 162	1	4 163	1	4 207	2	4 245	1	4 293	1	4 298	1	4 364	1	4 418	1	4 456	1	4 580	1	4 622	1	4 696	1	4 705	1	4 728	1	4 729	1	4 766	1	4 768	2	4 770	1	4 774	2	4 776	1	4 783	1	4 786	1	4 791	1	4 799	1	4 811	2	4 816	2	4 823	1	4 842	1	4 843	1	4 844	1	4 913	1	4 915	1	4 925	3	4 959	1	4 960	1	4 961	3	4 962	2	4 964	2	4 968	1	4 981	1	4 1068	1	4 1069	1	4 1070	1	4 1203	1	4 1214	1	4 1321	1	4 1400	1	4 1407	1	4 1445	1	4 1445	1	4
