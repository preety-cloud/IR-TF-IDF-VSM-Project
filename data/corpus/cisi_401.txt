Future Shock .A Toffler, A. This is a book about what happens to people when they are overwhelmed by change.  It is about the ways in which we adapt - or fail to adapt - to the future. Much has been written about the future.  Yet, for the most part, books about the world to come sound a harsh metallic note. These pages, by contrast, concern themselves with the "soft" or human side of tomorrow.  Moreover, they concern themselves with the steps by which we are likely to reach tomorrow. They deal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy and discard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit, the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.  The future of friendship and family life in probed.  Strange new subcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array of other subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex. .X 59	1	401 164	1	401 169	1	401 194	1	401 274	1	401 350	1	401 401	12	401 418	1	401 959	1	401 1025	1	401 1041	1	401 1069	1	401 1084	1	401 1150	1	401 1270	1	401 1298	1	401 1298	1	401
