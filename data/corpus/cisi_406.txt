Guidelines for Library Automation; a Handbook for Federal and Other Libraries .A Markuson, B.E. This book is one of the products of a contract initiated by the Automation Task Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by the U.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development Corporation.  The project included a questionnaire survey of all Federal libraries (2104), as of December, 1970, to gather systems planning data and to identify Federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems. Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems. From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in this Handbook. .X 91	1	406 114	1	406 177	1	406 178	1	406 232	1	406 241	1	406 287	2	406 331	1	406 348	1	406 358	1	406 375	1	406 406	11	406 408	3	406 607	1	406 725	1	406 849	1	406 896	1	406 897	1	406 916	2	406 925	1	406 946	1	406 948	1	406 959	1	406 960	1	406 962	1	406 979	1	406 1007	3	406 1033	2	406 1057	1	406 1079	1	406 1318	1	406 1364	1	406 1379	1	406 1400	1	406 1403	1	406 1403	1	406
