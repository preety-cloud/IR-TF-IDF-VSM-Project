Handbook of Data Processing for Libraries .A Hayes, R.M. .B 1970 The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians in resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  The intent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods available for the application of modern data processing to library operations. For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques into his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary of the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and the technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and, particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining the choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems, as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good management, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to educate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems of applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has already been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out analyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is developing better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a process that is already underway. .X 18	1	408 74	1	408 83	1	408 114	1	408 119	1	408 177	2	408 178	3	408 206	3	408 207	1	408 208	2	408 214	1	408 218	1	408 241	1	408 243	1	408 245	4	408 249	2	408 250	1	408 253	1	408 266	1	408 273	1	408 277	1	408 279	1	408 282	1	408 287	3	408 288	1	408 291	1	408 331	1	408 348	2	408 365	1	408 374	1	408 375	1	408 381	1	408 406	3	408 408	30	408 435	1	408 458	1	408 471	1	408 490	1	408 492	1	408 496	1	408 497	1	408 506	1	408 507	1	408 508	1	408 510	1	408 535	1	408 548	1	408 554	2	408 584	1	408 591	2	408 592	1	408 594	1	408 601	1	408 604	1	408 607	1	408 654	1	408 686	1	408 723	1	408 724	1	408 834	1	408 849	1	408 850	1	408 851	1	408 856	1	408 857	1	408 858	1	408 859	1	408 860	2	408 861	1	408 862	1	408 865	1	408 866	1	408 867	1	408 897	1	408 916	3	408 925	3	408 938	1	408 948	1	408 957	1	408 959	1	408 960	1	408 962	2	408 964	1	408 970	1	408 974	1	408 976	4	408 979	3	408 980	1	408 984	1	408 986	1	408 1005	1	408 1007	5	408 1012	2	408 1013	1	408 1033	1	408 1035	1	408 1042	1	408 1084	1	408 1087	1	408 1148	1	408 1227	1	408 1248	1	408 1317	4	408 1327	2	408 1353	1	408 1358	1	408 1359	1	408 1360	1	408 1400	5	408 1410	1	408 1424	1	408 1445	1	408 1445	1	408
