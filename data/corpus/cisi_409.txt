HDB of Data Processing for Libraries .A Hayes, R.M. The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Where one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth. This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different from that of the first. But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first edition. .X 62	1	409 141	1	409 310	1	409 318	1	409 363	2	409 409	8	409 462	1	409 604	1	409 645	1	409 647	1	409 651	1	409 737	1	409 739	1	409 853	1	409 875	1	409 881	1	409 882	1	409 883	2	409 884	1	409 885	1	409 886	1	409 887	1	409 917	1	409 999	1	409 1000	1	409 1001	1	409 1002	1	409 1003	1	409 1004	1	409 1274	1	409 1375	1	409 1376	1	409 1419	1	409 1419	1	409
