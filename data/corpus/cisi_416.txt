Human Behavior and the Principles of Least Effort An Introduction to Human Ecology .A Zipf, G.K. Nearly twenty-five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe, and if we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont to study, say, the social behavior of bees, or the nestbuilding habits of birds.  The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that ensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure of some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our behavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups. .X 19	2	416 44	2	416 57	2	416 76	1	416 81	1	416 175	1	416 228	3	416 309	1	416 318	1	416 321	2	416 324	2	416 329	4	416 359	3	416 416	17	416 442	3	416 450	3	416 453	1	416 477	1	416 495	2	416 498	1	416 511	5	416 521	1	416 524	3	416 563	1	416 565	2	416 567	2	416 591	1	416 700	1	416 748	1	416 759	2	416 765	3	416 778	2	416 787	1	416 791	3	416 835	2	416 851	2	416 852	1	416 862	2	416 867	1	416 872	1	416 875	2	416 893	1	416 894	1	416 970	1	416 1044	1	416 1081	1	416 1082	1	416 1083	1	416 1114	1	416 1122	1	416 1168	1	416 1172	2	416 1173	1	416 1182	2	416 1194	3	416 1196	1	416 1199	2	416 1201	1	416 1226	2	416 1309	1	416 1327	1	416 1381	1	416 1396	1	416 1398	1	416 1398	1	416
