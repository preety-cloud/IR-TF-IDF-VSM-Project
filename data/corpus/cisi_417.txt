Human Problem Solving .A Newell, A. Simon, H.A. The present study is concerned with the performance of intelligent adults in our own culture.  The tasks discussed are short (half-hour), moderately difficult problems of a symbolic nature.  The three main tasks we use - chess, symbolic logic, and algebra-like puzzles (called cryptarithmetic puzzles) - typify this class of problems.  The study is concerned with the integrated activities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concerned with perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables. The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with learning, and not at all with development or differences related to age. Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is, half a second or less).  Similarly, long-term integrated activities extending over periods of days or years receive no attention. .X 168	1	417 172	1	417 191	1	417 194	1	417 212	1	417 274	1	417 317	1	417 332	1	417 343	1	417 397	3	417 417	7	417 430	3	417 443	4	417 446	1	417 455	3	417 458	1	417 464	3	417 485	1	417 514	1	417 546	2	417 572	2	417 577	1	417 579	1	417 606	1	417 608	1	417 610	1	417 611	1	417 612	1	417 615	1	417 626	1	417 640	1	417 745	3	417 902	2	417 1033	1	417 1046	1	417 1084	1	417 1204	3	417 1279	1	417 1327	1	417 1387	2	417 1398	3	417 1399	1	417 1427	3	417 1427	3	417
