The Human Side of Enterprise .A McGregor, D. This volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that the human side of enterprise is "all of a piece" - that the theoretical assumptions management holds about controlling its human resources determine the whole character of the enterprise.  They determine also the quality of its successive generations of management. Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility and the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management is:  "What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about the most effective way to manage people?"  From the answer to this question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate. .X 4	1	418 173	1	418 227	1	418 270	1	418 285	1	418 293	1	418 296	1	418 298	2	418 301	1	418 302	1	418 306	1	418 401	1	418 418	13	418 549	1	418 578	1	418 768	1	418 774	1	418 823	1	418 842	1	418 843	1	418 844	1	418 925	1	418 1015	1	418 1041	1	418 1069	4	418 1070	5	418 1150	2	418 1186	1	418 1187	1	418 1205	2	418 1214	2	418 1233	1	418 1454	1	418 1455	3	418 1455	3	418
