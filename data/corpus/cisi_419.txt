A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary Information .A Luhn, H.P. Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed of different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.. .X 26	3	419 30	1	419 45	1	419 51	2	419 61	1	419 75	1	419 79	1	419 114	1	419 144	1	419 164	1	419 172	1	419 174	1	419 175	1	419 176	3	419 178	1	419 315	2	419 321	1	419 363	1	419 374	1	419 389	1	419 419	9	419 420	1	419 421	1	419 434	1	419 441	1	419 458	1	419 479	1	419 481	1	419 483	1	419 485	1	419 491	1	419 507	1	419 520	1	419 523	1	419 531	1	419 562	3	419 564	2	419 565	2	419 566	1	419 575	1	419 577	3	419 623	1	419 644	2	419 649	1	419 660	5	419 661	2	419 662	4	419 663	2	419 664	3	419 752	1	419 769	1	419 780	1	419 812	3	419 822	1	419 824	2	419 907	1	419 956	1	419 1144	1	419 1218	1	419 1279	1	419 1282	1	419 1294	1	419 1327	2	419 1414	1	419 1448	1	419 1448	1	419
