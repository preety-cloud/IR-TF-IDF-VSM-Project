R and D Project Selection:  Where We Stand .A Baker, N.R. Pound, W.H. A review of the literature on R and D project selection and an analysis of interview data suggest that there is a lack of testing and use of the methods proposed.. Several OR-MS methods are identified and their current status is indicated.. Three representative procedures are examined in some detail.. It is argued that both a lack of testing concerning feasibility and shortcomings of the models themselves, help to explain why the methods have not been used.. Some of these shortcomings are identified and discussed.. Implications for future research are presented.. .X 349	1	423 423	15	423 424	3	423 425	11	423 426	2	423 427	2	423 428	3	423 436	1	423 437	1	423 561	6	423 1039	4	423 1040	5	423 1154	3	423 1449	1	423 1449	1	423
