The Effects of Perceived Need and Means on the Generation of Ideas for Industrial Research and Development Projects .A Baker, Norman R. Siegman, Jack Rubenstein, Albert H. A flow model is presented which identifies some of the organizational factors influencing idea generation behavior in industrial R&D laboratories.. The model is constructed from literature-based propositions which make explicit the role played by several organizational factors identified in the model.. Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional laboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support the a priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of information are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need, problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or technique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the opportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative thought proposed by other investigators.. Finally, the organizational events, which were associated as "needs" events or "means" events for the ideas studies, are identified and analyzed with respect to both quantity and quality of ideas.. .X 109	1	426 356	1	426 391	1	426 423	2	426 424	1	426 425	1	426 426	6	426 427	1	426 428	1	426 436	1	426 437	1	426 561	1	426 656	1	426 658	1	426 1039	1	426 1040	1	426 1050	1	426 1150	1	426 1154	1	426 1288	1	426 1321	2	426 1449	1	426 1449	1	426
