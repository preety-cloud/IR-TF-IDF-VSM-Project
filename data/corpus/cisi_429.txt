The Information Content of Titles in Engineering Literature .A Bottle, Robert T. Since many alerting and information services rely very heavily on the use of titles to transfer information to the potential user, it is essential that he be aware of the proportion of the information contained in the complete document which will not be deducible from the title and which he will therefore miss.. Methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content of the titles of engineering paper and results presented for the amount and type of information lost through scanning title listing only.. Between one-third and one-half of indexable terms are not retrievable from article titles even if all possible synonyms and  related terms are used.. If all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information retrieved is increased by about 70 percent.. The problems of dealing with synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are discussed.. The possibility of using keywords in journal titles as supplementary retrieval tags is suggested since they were deemed useful in nearly one-third of the sample of papers analyzed.. .X 38	1	429 52	1	429 91	1	429 150	1	429 159	1	429 257	1	429 429	5	429 489	1	429 493	1	429 498	1	429 501	1	429 510	1	429 513	1	429 582	3	429 583	2	429 588	1	429 589	2	429 603	2	429 613	1	429 614	1	429 618	1	429 653	1	429 655	1	429 657	1	429 685	1	429 686	1	429 688	1	429 691	1	429 721	1	429 722	3	429 724	1	429 725	1	429 796	1	429 797	1	429 798	1	429 801	1	429 802	1	429 958	1	429 987	1	429 988	1	429 1195	1	429 1208	1	429 1293	1	429 1302	1	429 1405	1	429 1405	1	429
