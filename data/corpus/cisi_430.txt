On Fuzzy Mapping and Control .A Chang, Sheldon S.L. Zaden, Lofti A. A fuzzy mapping from X to Y is a fuzzy set on X * Y.. The concept is extended to fuzzy mappings of fuzzy set on X to Y, fuzzy function and its inverse, fuzzy parametric function, fuzzy observation, and control.. Set theoretical relations are obtained for fuzzy mappings, fuzzy functions, and fuzzy parametric functions.. It is shown that under certain conditions a precise control goal can be attained with fuzzy observation and control as long as the observations become sufficiently precise when the goal is approached.. .X 397	3	430 417	3	430 430	5	430 443	4	430 455	5	430 464	4	430 745	4	430 1204	3	430 1398	4	430 1427	3	430 1427	3	430
