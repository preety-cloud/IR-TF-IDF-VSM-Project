Illustrative Computer Programming for Libraries .A Davis, C.H. Illustrative Computer Programming is intended as a graded workbook or text supplement containing typical practical problems, suggested solutions, and tried analyses which emphasize programming efficiency and some of the major features of PL/I (Programming Language/One).  As such, it can be used alone or in combination with established PL/I textbooks such as those listed in the Selected Bibliography.  Programmers with knowledge of other languages will not be bothered by excessive introductory material, while beginners can learn much by looking at the solutions to the problems and their accompanying analyses. .X 125	1	432 127	1	432 129	1	432 363	1	432 432	5	432 460	1	432 461	1	432 580	1	432 622	1	432 642	1	432 643	1	432 644	1	432 645	1	432 646	1	432 649	1	432 650	1	432 708	1	432 736	1	432 737	1	432 738	1	432 739	1	432 741	1	432 852	1	432 1374	1	432 1376	1	432 1376	1	432
