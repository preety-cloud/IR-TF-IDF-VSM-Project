Improving Access to Library Resources .A Dougherty, R.M. The motivation for this investigation derived from a series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed to the design, development, and operation of non-traditional automated information systems.  At the time of the visits, the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically, they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the respective user communities.  Although few people associated with the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbal indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous. Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time and money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate. .X 10	1	433 115	1	433 161	1	433 190	1	433 225	1	433 234	1	433 236	1	433 244	1	433 295	1	433 297	1	433 300	1	433 303	1	433 304	1	433 305	1	433 306	1	433 358	2	433 385	1	433 394	1	433 433	8	433 459	1	433 534	1	433 624	1	433 631	1	433 647	1	433 654	1	433 702	1	433 731	1	433 732	1	433 817	1	433 820	1	433 823	1	433 825	1	433 826	1	433 827	1	433 828	1	433 937	1	433 946	1	433 947	1	433 948	1	433 972	1	433 1017	1	433 1058	1	433 1146	1	433 1230	1	433 1257	1	433 1373	1	433 1390	1	433 1390	1	433
