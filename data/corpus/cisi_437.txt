Industry and Technical Progress .A Carter, C.F. This book is written in the belief that the full and speedy application of science in industry is necessary to economic progress, and should indeed be one of the most important objectives of national policy.  This being so, it is important to identify the hindrances to speedy application.  Many people have already drawn attention to particular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report did not consider that there was any up-to-date assessment of the problem which attempted to look at it as a whole, in all its variety and complexity. Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us; an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British industry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first impression and summary. .X 312	1	437 356	2	437 391	2	437 423	1	437 424	1	437 425	1	437 426	1	437 436	4	437 437	5	437 561	1	437 658	2	437 1036	1	437 1039	1	437 1040	1	437 1041	1	437 1050	2	437 1154	1	437 1187	1	437 1288	2	437 1333	1	437 1406	1	437 1406	1	437
