Research Studies in Patterns of Scientific Communication: I. General Description of Research Program .A Garvey, William D. Lin, Nan, Nelson, Carnot E. Tomita, Kazuo This article is the first in a series which described the general procedures and some findings of over seventy studies which we conducted from 1966 to 1971 on the information-exchange activities of over 12000 scientists and engineers in a sample of nine physical, social and engineering sciences.. We designed the studies so that (a) the full spectrum of scientific communication media could be explored, (b) the various studies were coupled in order that data obtained from one study could be directly related to those obtained from other studies, (c) the scheduling of the studies was conducted in real time in order that the same body of information could be followed from its inception to its final integration into the general body of scientific knowledge, and (d) the same studies were conducted for all nine disciplines being studied in order that genuine comparisons could be made among them.. The data are now stored on machine-readable magnetic tapes and will be made available to scholars in the field of information science.. .X 48	1	439 91	1	439 96	1	439 98	2	439 123	1	439 300	1	439 421	1	439 439	7	439 440	3	439 456	1	439 515	1	439 528	1	439 533	1	439 580	1	439 609	1	439 614	1	439 618	1	439 624	1	439 635	1	439 696	1	439 727	1	439 809	1	439 813	1	439 818	1	439 870	1	439 1030	2	439 1296	1	439 1298	1	439 1338	1	439 1386	1	439 1396	1	439 1396	1	439
