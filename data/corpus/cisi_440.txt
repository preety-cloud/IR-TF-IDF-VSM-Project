Research Studies in Scientific Communication: IV. The Continuity of Dissemination of Information by "Productive Scientists" .A Garvey, William D. Lin, Nan Tomita, Kazuo This article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which were conducted over a 4,5-year period (1966-1971).. The series of articles sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media, from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published.. The present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information exchange by "productive scientists" two years after the publication of their articles in 1968/1969.. The results indicate that about half of the authors had changed to a subject-matter area which differed from that of their earlier articles, however, such shifts did not decrease authors' productivity nor greatly increase their information needs.. .X 18	1	440 48	1	440 91	1	440 96	1	440 98	1	440 123	1	440 125	1	440 145	1	440 211	1	440 378	1	440 421	1	440 439	3	440 440	5	440 452	1	440 453	1	440 456	1	440 467	1	440 468	1	440 495	1	440 506	1	440 508	1	440 511	1	440 512	1	440 514	1	440 517	1	440 520	1	440 521	1	440 523	1	440 524	1	440 526	1	440 528	1	440 533	2	440 576	1	440 580	2	440 604	1	440 609	2	440 612	1	440 619	1	440 622	1	440 623	1	440 629	1	440 631	1	440 632	1	440 633	1	440 696	1	440 699	1	440 700	1	440 705	1	440 707	1	440 723	1	440 726	1	440 727	2	440 728	1	440 729	1	440 730	1	440 731	1	440 754	1	440 809	1	440 812	1	440 813	2	440 814	1	440 820	1	440 822	1	440 866	1	440 870	2	440 873	1	440 1030	1	440 1078	1	440 1089	1	440 1091	1	440 1143	1	440 1264	1	440 1298	1	440 1302	1	440 1303	1	440 1319	1	440 1338	1	440 1366	1	440 1367	1	440 1368	1	440 1386	1	440 1396	2	440 1396	2	440
