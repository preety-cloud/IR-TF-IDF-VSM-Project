Inference and Disputed Authorship .A Mosteller, F. We apply a 200-year-old mathematical theorem to a 175-year-old historical problem, more to advance statistics than history.  Though problems of disputed authorship are common in history, literature, and politics, scholars regard their solutions as minor advances.  For us the question of whether Hamilton or Madison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods. While we help solve this historical problem, our practical application of Bayes' theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a method being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics.  Furthermore, large practical applications have until now been few, and our work helps fill that gap. .X 19	1	441 51	1	441 69	1	441 75	1	441 79	3	441 226	1	441 315	1	441 324	2	441 419	1	441 441	7	441 518	1	441 531	1	441 575	2	441 577	2	441 644	1	441 649	1	441 660	3	441 752	1	441 755	1	441 780	1	441 812	1	441 824	1	441 956	1	441 1084	1	441 1202	1	441 1282	2	441 1294	2	441 1294	2	441
