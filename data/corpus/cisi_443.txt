Quantitative Fuzzy Semantics .A Zaden, L.A. The point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language, L, as a fuzzy relation from a set of terms, T = {x}, to a universe of discourse, U = {y}.. As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of membership, mL(x,y), in L.. Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y).. The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing the role of a name for M(x).. If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is, x = x1 ... xn, xi  T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are deduced from the syntax tree of x.. The use of this approach is illustrated by examples.. .X 168	1	443 317	1	443 332	1	443 397	3	443 417	4	443 430	4	443 443	5	443 455	4	443 464	3	443 546	1	443 572	1	443 608	1	443 745	4	443 902	1	443 1046	1	443 1204	3	443 1327	1	443 1398	4	443 1399	1	443 1427	3	443 1427	3	443
