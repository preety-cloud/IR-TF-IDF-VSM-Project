Computer Assisted Indexing .A Gray, W. A. The paper describes a technique which enables an on line computer based information retrieval system to aid the indexers by selecting possible index terms to be assigned to a new document entering the system.. The method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the new article.. This produces a list of index terms weighted according to their expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article.. Thus, the indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an aid.. An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial set of documents.. These documents have already been indexed for the MEDLARS system.. The list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each document.. The results of this comparison are encouraging, and they are discussed in the paper.. The economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information retrieval system is considered.. This included the expected benefits, and an estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer time and indexer time.. .X 39	1	446 50	1	446 172	1	446 174	1	446 175	1	446 176	1	446 191	1	446 194	1	446 212	1	446 274	1	446 326	1	446 332	1	446 396	1	446 417	1	446 446	6	446 458	1	446 473	1	446 485	2	446 489	2	446 493	1	446 499	3	446 500	2	446 503	1	446 517	2	446 522	1	446 527	2	446 572	2	446 576	1	446 577	1	446 579	1	446 615	1	446 616	1	446 632	1	446 640	1	446 773	1	446 830	1	446 902	1	446 958	1	446 1033	1	446 1084	1	446 1207	1	446 1279	1	446 1283	1	446 1327	1	446 1387	1	446 1426	1	446 1426	1	446
