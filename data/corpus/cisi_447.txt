A Note on the Concept of "Relevance" .A Foskett, D.J. Two recent articles in this journal (Konigova [1], Cooper [2]) have gone beyond the usual slapdash use of the words "relevant" and "relevance," and have attempted to explicate the concept further.  Both attempts only partially succeed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less precise language; for example, in defining "second order noise," she uses the ambiguous phrase "a formally relevant document which is not really relevant" - presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of the enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, "no account is taken of the subjective relevance (pertinence)."  Yet this is surely the true aim of the system. .X 15	1	447 29	1	447 35	1	447 42	1	447 43	1	447 58	1	447 70	1	447 84	1	447 152	1	447 313	1	447 444	2	447 445	3	447 447	7	447 449	3	447 474	1	447 486	1	447 514	1	447 523	1	447 532	2	447 554	1	447 557	1	447 574	1	447 625	2	447 639	1	447 660	1	447 740	1	447 741	1	447 752	1	447 762	1	447 764	1	447 803	1	447 806	1	447 893	1	447 1016	1	447 1030	1	447 1045	1	447 1084	1	447 1195	1	447 1201	1	447 1235	1	447 1281	1	447 1285	1	447 1319	1	447 1327	1	447 1386	1	447 1386	1	447
