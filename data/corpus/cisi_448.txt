An Evaluation of Query Expansion by the Addition of Clustered Terms for a Document Retrieval System .A Minker, Jack Wilson, Gerald A. Zimmerman, Barbara H. An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be extracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results.. Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or other  situations.. .X 51	1	448 69	1	448 71	2	448 77	2	448 79	2	448 124	1	448 125	1	448 165	1	448 168	1	448 175	2	448 176	2	448 315	1	448 381	1	448 382	1	448 448	6	448 452	1	448 462	1	448 480	1	448 483	1	448 484	2	448 486	1	448 488	2	448 491	1	448 493	1	448 503	1	448 507	1	448 509	2	448 510	1	448 511	1	448 512	1	448 516	1	448 517	1	448 518	1	448 520	1	448 521	1	448 522	2	448 523	1	448 526	1	448 527	2	448 528	2	448 529	1	448 531	1	448 565	3	448 566	1	448 575	1	448 581	1	448 596	1	448 603	1	448 608	1	448 610	1	448 615	1	448 625	1	448 626	1	448 633	1	448 636	1	448 659	3	448 660	1	448 700	1	448 705	1	448 707	1	448 715	1	448 727	1	448 754	2	448 790	1	448 805	1	448 809	1	448 810	2	448 812	2	448 813	1	448 814	1	448 817	2	448 824	2	448 825	1	448 875	1	448 894	2	448 1051	1	448 1202	1	448 1294	2	448 1303	1	448 1327	2	448 1364	1	448 1366	1	448 1367	1	448 1368	1	448 1419	1	448 1427	1	448 1427	1	448
