Fuzzy Sets .A Zaden, L. A. A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership.. Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one.. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established.. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.. .X 25	1	455 39	1	455 52	1	455 61	1	455 66	1	455 175	4	455 310	1	455 315	2	455 318	1	455 350	1	455 397	4	455 417	3	455 420	1	455 430	5	455 443	4	455 455	18	455 464	6	455 605	1	455 632	1	455 667	1	455 745	6	455 893	1	455 1117	1	455 1119	1	455 1137	1	455 1140	1	455 1141	1	455 1144	1	455 1204	3	455 1287	1	455 1327	1	455 1398	4	455 1409	1	455 1427	3	455 1427	3	455
