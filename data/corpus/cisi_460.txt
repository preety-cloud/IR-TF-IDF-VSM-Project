Information Retrieval and Documentation in Chemistry .A Davis, C.H. For several years we have thought that greater effort should be expended to create more understanding of the processes involved in information storage, retrieval, and dissemination.  Too often, concepts deriving from science and technology are made to seem unnecessarily abstruse, either inadvertently or deliberately to preserve some sort of mystique.  This book is intended to explicate, if not popularize, major aspects of I S & R processes as they are exemplified by the field of chemical documentation.  To the extent that this work is found useful by chemists, information specialists, and all individuals interested in scientific documentation, we shall be gratified. .X 125	1	460 127	1	460 129	1	460 363	1	460 432	1	460 451	1	460 460	5	460 461	1	460 526	1	460 546	1	460 580	1	460 606	1	460 609	1	460 612	1	460 622	1	460 637	1	460 641	1	460 642	2	460 643	1	460 644	1	460 645	1	460 646	1	460 649	1	460 650	1	460 708	1	460 733	1	460 736	1	460 737	1	460 738	1	460 739	1	460 741	1	460 1374	1	460 1376	1	460 1377	1	460 1377	1	460
