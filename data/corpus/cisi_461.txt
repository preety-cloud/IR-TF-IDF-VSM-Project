Information Retrieval and Processing .A Doyle, L.B. The present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflect the fact that the reader of today's book is much more likely to be an interested college student with a great awareness of the current information revolution than was the case ten years ago.  Thus, hardware, materials, and processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first, in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per se begins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, these chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book which adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplified concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine. Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user studies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have developed strongly since 1963.  .X 6	1	461 125	1	461 127	1	461 129	1	461 363	2	461 403	1	461 432	1	461 460	1	461 461	6	461 551	1	461 580	1	461 622	1	461 642	1	461 643	1	461 644	1	461 645	1	461 646	1	461 649	1	461 650	1	461 708	1	461 736	1	461 737	1	461 738	1	461 739	1	461 741	1	461 1374	1	461 1376	1	461 1376	1	461
