Information Retrieval .A Van Rijsbergen, C.J. The material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate information (or computer) science students, postgraduate library science students, and research workers in the field of IR.  Some of the chapters, particularly Chapter 6, make simple use of a little advanced mathematics.  However, the necessary mathematical tools can be easily mastered from numerous mathematical texts that now exist and in any case references have been given where the mathematics occur. .X 62	1	462 310	1	462 318	1	462 363	1	462 409	1	462 448	1	462 462	5	462 604	1	462 616	1	462 660	1	462 737	1	462 853	1	462 875	1	462 883	1	462 1202	1	462 1274	1	462 1419	1	462 1419	1	462
