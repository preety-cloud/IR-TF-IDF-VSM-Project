Similarity Relations and Fuzzy Orderings .A Zaden, L. A. The notion of "similarity" as defined in this paper is essentially a generalization of the notion of equivalence.. In the same vein, a fuzzy ordering is a generalization of the concept of ordering.. For example, the relation x >> y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers.. More correctly, a similarity relation, S is a fuzzy relation which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.. Various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are investigated and, as an illustration, an extended version of Szpilrajn's theorem is proved.. .X 175	1	464 179	1	464 397	3	464 417	3	464 430	4	464 443	3	464 455	6	464 464	7	464 509	1	464 564	1	464 566	1	464 745	3	464 853	1	464 1117	1	464 1140	1	464 1204	3	464 1398	3	464 1427	3	464 1427	3	464
