Information Service in Libraries .A Crowley, T. The two studies presented here represent efforts to measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusive fashion:  that is, to apply certain tests generally similar to portions of the normal workload without drawing attention to the fact that a test is being carried out.  The two projects were rather different as to purpose, method, and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance). Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time, arose partly from his experience in a county library.  His curiousity about the real result of the reference activities (as different from merely counting the questions answered) led him to ask, "Is there substantial difference between the claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual result as observed in a number of different situations by individuals posing as clients?"  The study which followed from this question was, then, exploratory and necessarily less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this pair. .X 161	1	470 364	1	470 387	1	470 470	11	470 925	1	470 1008	2	470 1018	1	470 1032	1	470 1056	1	470 1145	1	470 1263	1	470 1353	1	470 1373	1	470 1380	1	470 1384	1	470 1423	1	470 1423	1	470
