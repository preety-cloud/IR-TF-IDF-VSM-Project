Information Storage and Retrieval: tools, elements, theories .A Becker, J. This textbook grew out of some discussions between the authors about the interdisciplinary character of the field of information storage and retrieval.  We both felt that the need existed to show what each professional group concerned with the solution of information storage and retrieval problems could contribute.  A university-level course was developed, based on the concept that each person should be made aware of how others could help him.  The course was presented about a dozen times over the ensuing years, and this book is based on it. .X 127	1	471 133	1	471 175	2	471 177	1	471 337	1	471 374	1	471 408	1	471 458	1	471 471	7	471 660	1	471 810	1	471 960	1	471 1053	1	471 1082	1	471 1219	2	471 1227	1	471 1231	1	471 1248	1	471 1306	1	471 1327	1	471 1417	1	471 1418	1	471 1418	1	471
