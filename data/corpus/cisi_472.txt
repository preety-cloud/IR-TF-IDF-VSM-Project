Information Storage and Retrieval Systems for Individual Researchers .A Jahoda, G. This book deals with the simplest of the three corrective measures - the improvement of the document retrieval system.  There are different ways and means of accomplishing this, and these methods of improving the organization and retrieval of personal document collections are the principal topics to be covered.  The book is addressed primarily to the researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his document collection or start an index to his document collection but does not quite know how to go about it.  An index is herein defined as a systematic organization of a collection of documents or data.  There are indexes to various types of document and data collections, and there are various types of indexes.  Examples of familiar indexes are indexes to individual books, to collections of books (the card catalog in a library), to the contents of journals or periodicals (for example, the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature), to collections of facts (for example, a telephone directory), or to numeric data (such as physical constants of a group of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study). .X 161	1	472 197	1	472 375	1	472 445	1	472 454	1	472 472	6	472 503	1	472 506	1	472 507	1	472 554	1	472 579	1	472 591	1	472 593	1	472 594	1	472 595	1	472 596	1	472 597	1	472 599	1	472 600	1	472 603	1	472 604	1	472 606	1	472 723	1	472 724	1	472 801	1	472 805	1	472 806	1	472 836	1	472 866	1	472 867	1	472 956	1	472 989	1	472 1298	1	472 1299	1	472 1327	1	472 1405	1	472 1405	1	472
