A Methodology for Test and Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems .A Goffman, W. Newill, V.A. A recognition of the importance of useful evaluative techniques is an indirect or secondary result of the hugely expanded national investment in scientific research.  Such recognition has followed the expenditure of much time and money on the development of information systems which utilize advances in information handling and data processing (primarily computer-oriented) to handle the "explosion" of recorded information.  Information scientists from a typically diverse group of parent disciplines are now cooperating not only to develop methodologies of evaluation of such systems, but to apply them. .X 27	1	474 29	1	474 35	1	474 42	1	474 43	1	474 58	1	474 70	2	474 73	1	474 75	1	474 84	1	474 134	1	474 149	1	474 319	1	474 389	1	474 390	2	474 444	1	474 445	1	474 447	1	474 449	1	474 474	7	474 486	1	474 532	1	474 565	1	474 566	1	474 625	1	474 660	1	474 762	1	474 764	1	474 773	1	474 780	3	474 785	2	474 893	1	474 966	1	474 1016	1	474 1030	1	474 1045	1	474 1084	1	474 1195	1	474 1201	1	474 1235	1	474 1255	1	474 1279	1	474 1281	1	474 1282	3	474 1285	1	474 1307	1	474 1422	1	474 1422	1	474
