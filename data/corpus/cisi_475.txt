Factors Affecting the Preferences of Industrial Personnel for Information Gathering Methods .A Rosenberg, Victor A structured questionnaire was administered to professional personnel in industrial and government organizations, asking the subjects to rank eight information gathering methods according to their preference in given hypothetical situation.. The subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a seven point scale according to (a) ease of use and (b) amount of information expected.. The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time spent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated "research" and "nonresearch".. A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 in nonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel.. The results of the study infer that the ease of use of an information gathering method is more important than the amount of information expected for information gathering methods in industrial and government, regardless of the research orientation of the users.. .X 2	1	475 13	1	475 15	1	475 29	1	475 31	1	475 32	1	475 66	1	475 76	1	475 95	1	475 100	1	475 103	1	475 132	1	475 137	1	475 139	1	475 152	2	475 155	1	475 157	1	475 183	1	475 191	1	475 195	1	475 201	1	475 203	1	475 204	1	475 210	1	475 312	1	475 356	1	475 359	1	475 371	1	475 373	1	475 379	1	475 382	1	475 459	1	475 475	11	475 552	1	475 592	1	475 594	1	475 602	1	475 656	1	475 658	3	475 664	1	475 728	1	475 748	1	475 760	2	475 770	1	475 771	1	475 774	1	475 775	1	475 776	1	475 783	1	475 788	2	475 789	1	475 837	1	475 839	1	475 907	1	475 967	2	475 968	1	475 977	1	475 1019	1	475 1038	1	475 1055	1	475 1056	1	475 1173	1	475 1203	1	475 1254	1	475 1281	1	475 1284	1	475 1288	1	475 1291	1	475 1303	1	475 1358	1	475 1361	1	475 1404	1	475 1451	1	475 1451	1	475
