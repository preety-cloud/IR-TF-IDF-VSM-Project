On the Articulation of Surrogates:  An Attempt at an Epistemological Foundation .A Perreault, J.M. There are two major purposes, in mind, for this gathering.  The first is the most general that can be proposed for any gathering: the simple advantage of bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least a small class of problems - especially when this problem has not previously benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators. To further such thematic collaboration, the formal presentations have been scheduled no more than three each day, with time left after each presentation for (formal) discussion here in the conference room, and with as much time as possible - given the number of presentations - left free for informal discussion. The second purpose is one of even greater necessity, in my opinion, though one not so obvious as the first.  Over and above the hope for interchange of what has already been thought out - in the form of personal contact, where the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the printed word in its usual and ineffable way - it is my hope that we will all be able (especially in our informal discussions) to penetrate beyond mere similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic relationship. .X 29	1	476 68	1	476 69	1	476 117	1	476 154	1	476 165	1	476 175	1	476 257	1	476 259	1	476 260	1	476 261	1	476 346	1	476 382	1	476 445	1	476 458	1	476 476	5	476 477	3	476 478	1	476 479	1	476 480	1	476 484	1	476 485	1	476 525	1	476 542	1	476 566	1	476 590	1	476 621	1	476 653	1	476 668	1	476 670	1	476 671	1	476 674	1	476 680	1	476 683	1	476 689	1	476 704	1	476 715	1	476 758	1	476 781	1	476 797	1	476 819	1	476 838	1	476 1066	1	476 1077	1	476 1118	1	476 1175	1	476 1231	3	476 1255	1	476 1259	2	476 1391	2	476 1394	1	476 1429	2	476 1430	2	476 1430	2	476
