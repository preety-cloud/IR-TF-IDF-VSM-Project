Some Remarks on Information Languages, Their Analysis and Comparison .A Soergel, D. "The machine language [information language in our terminology D.S.] should not be confused with the machine code: (Upenskii, 59:357).  In Ranganathan's more general terms: There should be no confusion between the idea plane and the notational plane.  Many difficulties in classification arise from this confusion.  This paper is devoted mainly to problems on the idea plane. "The IR-language I want to talk about, is the language in which the information to be retrieved is formulated, i.e. a declarative sentence language, not the imperative sentence language of the programmer-retriever" (Bohnert in Samet, 62.1:10), that is, the information language should not be confused with the programming language.  (To avoid misunderstandings it would perhaps be better to say "descriptive" instead of "declarative" and to state explicitly that in a descriptive sentence an imperative may be described which is, however, not to be executed by the system but to be retrieved by appropriate searches.) .X 29	1	477 68	1	477 69	1	477 151	1	477 154	1	477 160	1	477 175	1	477 258	1	477 259	1	477 261	1	477 263	1	477 309	1	477 346	1	477 382	1	477 388	1	477 416	1	477 454	1	477 458	1	477 476	3	477 477	9	477 478	1	477 479	1	477 480	1	477 484	1	477 485	1	477 501	1	477 504	1	477 516	1	477 542	1	477 558	1	477 566	1	477 600	1	477 653	4	477 680	1	477 704	1	477 746	1	477 758	1	477 781	3	477 791	1	477 802	1	477 838	3	477 852	1	477 898	2	477 901	1	477 970	1	477 1066	1	477 1074	1	477 1075	1	477 1118	1	477 1175	1	477 1231	2	477 1259	4	477 1391	5	477 1394	1	477 1402	1	477 1414	1	477 1422	1	477 1429	3	477 1430	3	477 1430	3	477
