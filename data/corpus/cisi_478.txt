Concept Organization for Information Retrieval .A Farradane, J. All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them. The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings, as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed in the form of groupings called classes. .X 29	1	478 68	1	478 69	1	478 160	2	478 175	1	478 257	1	478 261	1	478 346	1	478 382	1	478 458	1	478 476	1	478 477	1	478 478	9	478 479	1	478 480	4	478 484	1	478 485	1	478 516	3	478 566	1	478 680	1	478 704	1	478 746	1	478 758	2	478 781	1	478 785	1	478 825	1	478 1118	1	478 1175	1	478 1215	3	478 1448	1	478 1448	1	478
