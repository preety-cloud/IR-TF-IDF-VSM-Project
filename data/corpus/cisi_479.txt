Automatic Term Classifications and Retrieval .A Sparck-Jones, K. Needham, R. M. Recent research at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been concerned with the application of the automatic classification techniques associated with the "theory of clumps" to document description obtained from the Aslib-Cranfield project, and with the use of the resulting term classifications in retrieval.. A substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co-occurrences in document descriptions, and finds classes of terms with strong similarity connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its complement; and which retrieves using single terms and/or term classes according to specification, and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets of requests.. Serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and with different modes of using term classes are still in progress, so on definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are presented.. .X 26	1	479 29	1	479 45	1	479 68	1	479 69	2	479 168	1	479 174	2	479 175	2	479 261	1	479 310	1	479 324	1	479 346	1	479 382	2	479 419	1	479 422	1	479 454	1	479 458	1	479 476	1	479 477	1	479 478	1	479 479	6	479 480	1	479 483	1	479 484	1	479 485	4	479 488	1	479 509	1	479 558	1	479 562	1	479 564	2	479 566	3	479 570	1	479 660	1	479 661	2	479 662	2	479 663	2	479 664	1	479 680	1	479 704	1	479 769	2	479 781	1	479 1118	1	479 1144	1	479 1175	1	479 1327	1	479 1419	1	479 1419	1	479
