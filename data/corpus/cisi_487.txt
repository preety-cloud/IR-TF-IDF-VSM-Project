An Indirect Method of Information Retrieval .A Goffman, William The information retrieval process, treated strictly as a matching procedure, has the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query, and that it overlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document depends upon what is already known about the subject, and in term affects the relevance of other documents subsequently examined.. A mathematical model of a search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers.. The results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct method.. No spurious material was retrieved by either method.. .X 28	1	487 45	1	487 63	1	487 111	1	487 112	1	487 113	1	487 175	1	487 199	1	487 319	1	487 348	1	487 359	1	487 360	1	487 389	1	487 390	1	487 444	1	487 486	1	487 487	7	487 502	1	487 573	1	487 579	1	487 596	1	487 600	1	487 601	1	487 799	1	487 805	1	487 807	1	487 825	1	487 853	1	487 863	1	487 864	1	487 911	1	487 956	1	487 963	1	487 987	1	487 988	1	487 989	1	487 1016	1	487 1084	1	487 1085	1	487 1152	1	487 1215	1	487 1265	1	487 1294	1	487 1327	1	487 1327	1	487
