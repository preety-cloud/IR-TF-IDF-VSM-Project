Experiments in Book Indexing by Computer .A Borko, Harold The most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance purposes.. While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of "good index terms", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms.. Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques.. .X 38	1	489 77	1	489 79	1	489 84	1	489 159	1	489 168	1	489 174	1	489 175	1	489 257	1	489 317	1	489 320	1	489 324	1	489 332	1	489 396	1	489 429	1	489 446	2	489 488	2	489 489	7	489 490	1	489 491	1	489 492	1	489 493	4	489 494	1	489 495	1	489 496	1	489 497	1	489 498	2	489 499	4	489 500	2	489 501	1	489 517	1	489 527	1	489 570	1	489 581	2	489 582	1	489 583	2	489 584	1	489 586	1	489 653	1	489 655	1	489 659	2	489 688	1	489 785	1	489 790	1	489 795	1	489 796	1	489 797	1	489 798	1	489 801	2	489 802	1	489 986	1	489 1131	1	489 1294	2	489 1327	1	489 1405	1	489 1443	1	489 1443	1	489
