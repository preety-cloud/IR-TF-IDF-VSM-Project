The Cost and Costing of Information Storage and Retrieval .A Sessions, V.S. This presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is based on data gathered by Project URBANDOC during the course of four years in developing documentation services for the literature of urban planning and renewal.  It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars is no small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban Renewal Demonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated the Project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems. URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of literature which had been neglected by the information science community before the advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards. .X 27	1	496 38	1	496 74	2	496 83	2	496 84	1	496 158	1	496 166	1	496 245	1	496 273	1	496 279	1	496 288	1	496 331	1	496 381	1	496 408	1	496 488	1	496 489	1	496 490	4	496 491	4	496 492	3	496 493	1	496 494	1	496 495	2	496 496	7	496 497	3	496 498	1	496 499	1	496 500	1	496 581	2	496 582	1	496 583	1	496 584	2	496 586	1	496 591	2	496 592	1	496 657	1	496 659	1	496 690	1	496 723	1	496 724	1	496 795	1	496 801	1	496 815	1	496 834	1	496 860	1	496 925	1	496 957	1	496 976	1	496 986	1	496 1012	1	496 1035	1	496 1148	1	496 1227	1	496 1293	1	496 1294	2	496 1295	1	496 1296	1	496 1317	1	496 1353	1	496 1359	1	496 1360	1	496 1400	1	496 1410	1	496 1424	1	496 1424	1	496
