Some Cost Estimates for Bibliographical Searching in a Large-Scale Social Sciences Information System .A Thompson, G.K. Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation today grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development. An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation, file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted information systems may make sense within individual institutional environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores. .X 27	1	497 38	1	497 74	1	497 83	1	497 84	1	497 158	1	497 172	1	497 218	1	497 243	1	497 253	1	497 375	1	497 408	1	497 482	1	497 488	1	497 489	1	497 490	3	497 491	3	497 492	4	497 493	1	497 494	1	497 495	2	497 496	3	497 497	5	497 498	1	497 499	1	497 500	1	497 506	1	497 507	1	497 508	1	497 510	1	497 548	1	497 581	2	497 583	1	497 584	2	497 586	1	497 591	1	497 594	1	497 601	1	497 604	1	497 607	1	497 659	1	497 795	1	497 801	1	497 866	1	497 867	1	497 986	1	497 1035	1	497 1042	1	497 1087	1	497 1207	1	497 1294	2	497 1327	1	497 1327	1	497
