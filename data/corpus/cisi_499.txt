Experiments in Automatic Extracting and Indexing .A Earl, Lois L. This article reports on several experiments in automatic extracting and one experiment in automating indexing.. Nine chapters, each from a different technical book, were used as a text corpus for all the experiments.. In the first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases.. There is every indication that satisfactory back-of-the-book indexes could be produced automatically, with post-editing to delete superfluous items.. .X 26	1	499 35	1	499 38	1	499 77	1	499 79	1	499 84	1	499 168	1	499 174	1	499 175	1	499 176	1	499 315	2	499 317	1	499 320	1	499 324	1	499 332	1	499 396	1	499 420	3	499 446	3	499 488	2	499 489	4	499 490	1	499 491	1	499 492	1	499 493	3	499 494	1	499 495	1	499 496	1	499 497	1	499 498	1	499 499	9	499 500	3	499 517	2	499 522	1	499 527	2	499 570	1	499 571	2	499 576	1	499 581	3	499 583	1	499 584	1	499 586	1	499 657	1	499 659	2	499 664	1	499 666	3	499 790	1	499 795	1	499 801	1	499 830	1	499 986	1	499 1294	2	499 1327	1	499 1443	2	499 1443	2	499
