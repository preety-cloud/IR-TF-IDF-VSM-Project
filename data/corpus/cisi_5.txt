A Library Management Game: a report on a research project .A Brophy, P. Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the "real thing" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology. .X 4	2	5 5	6	5 90	1	5 91	1	5 115	1	5 158	1	5 207	1	5 222	1	5 223	1	5 234	1	5 245	2	5 364	2	5 365	1	5 368	1	5 435	1	5 535	1	5 553	1	5 598	1	5 615	1	5 764	1	5 766	1	5 811	2	5 815	1	5 816	2	5 818	1	5 823	1	5 842	1	5 915	1	5 925	2	5 944	1	5 948	1	5 957	1	5 959	1	5 960	1	5 961	2	5 962	1	5 964	1	5 1023	2	5 1219	1	5 1227	1	5 1257	1	5 1365	1	5 1390	1	5 1400	1	5 1400	1	5
