Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules .A Schultz, Claire K. To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines.. .X 38	1	500 84	1	500 158	1	500 174	1	500 175	1	500 176	1	500 332	1	500 446	2	500 488	1	500 489	2	500 490	1	500 491	1	500 492	1	500 493	2	500 494	1	500 495	1	500 496	1	500 497	1	500 499	3	500 500	5	500 517	2	500 522	1	500 527	2	500 576	1	500 581	1	500 583	1	500 584	1	500 586	1	500 659	1	500 795	1	500 801	1	500 830	1	500 986	1	500 1294	1	500 1317	1	500 1327	1	500 1400	1	500 1400	1	500
