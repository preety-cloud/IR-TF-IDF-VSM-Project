Five Years, Five Volumes and 2345 Pages of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology .A Saracevic, Tefko The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) is now 5 years old.. In these 5 years ARIST became not only a very much used and quoted tool, but also an established institution.. This is testified by the fact that each of the five volumes was the year's most frequently and most comprehensively reviewed book in the field.. The ARIST effort is unparalleled in great many fields.. Currently we are entering an era of intense concern about and reactions to science and technology.. All sciences and technologies are subject to questioning, scrutiny and evaluation both inside and outside of their subject areas.. Scrutiny of a field may be attempted by a scrutiny of its important literature items.. With 5 years and five volumes ARIST invites and affords a perspective.. This review is attempting in broad brushstrokes to be a critical examination of the underlying structure, and literature base as well as the achievements of the ARIST effort as a whole.. .X 19	1	505 37	1	505 39	1	505 40	1	505 47	1	505 88	1	505 97	1	505 102	1	505 103	1	505 162	1	505 228	1	505 233	1	505 253	1	505 313	1	505 359	3	505 377	1	505 379	1	505 395	1	505 459	1	505 505	6	505 515	1	505 560	1	505 573	2	505 594	1	505 598	1	505 599	1	505 616	1	505 618	1	505 632	1	505 635	1	505 667	1	505 748	3	505 749	1	505 751	2	505 759	1	505 764	1	505 765	2	505 777	1	505 778	3	505 782	1	505 791	1	505 803	1	505 804	1	505 805	1	505 885	1	505 893	1	505 952	1	505 972	1	505 1016	2	505 1061	1	505 1082	1	505 1083	2	505 1085	2	505 1086	2	505 1087	1	505 1090	1	505 1182	3	505 1200	1	505 1201	1	505 1274	1	505 1277	1	505 1278	1	505 1280	1	505 1287	1	505 1301	1	505 1302	1	505 1304	1	505 1313	1	505 1338	1	505 1344	1	505 1347	1	505 1380	1	505 1428	1	505 1444	1	505 1444	1	505
