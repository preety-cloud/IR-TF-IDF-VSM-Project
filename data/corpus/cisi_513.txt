Communication and Information Processing within Scientific Disciplines: Empirical Findings for Psychology .A Garvey, William D. Griffith, Belver C. Scientific disciplines can be regarded as social devices which have, as one function, the analysis and reduction of raw information to assimilated knowledge of a type which can be transmitted through professional training.. Data on information flow in psychology reveal feedback to scientific workers and result in refinements of the product of research; later disseminations are interwoven with processes of evaluation and selection and are directed toward the creation of an integrated and tested body of knowledge.. The reported data finish an empirical base for Ziman's consensual model of science and illuminate difficulties which have arisen in the design and implementation of information systems.. .X 47	1	513 48	1	513 91	1	513 102	1	513 113	1	513 429	1	513 503	1	513 513	5	513 545	1	513 582	2	513 588	1	513 589	1	513 603	1	513 613	1	513 614	1	513 618	1	513 657	1	513 685	2	513 686	2	513 691	1	513 721	1	513 722	2	513 724	1	513 725	2	513 770	1	513 776	2	513 958	1	513 987	1	513 988	1	513 1030	1	513 1208	1	513 1210	1	513 1290	1	513 1293	1	513 1300	1	513 1302	1	513 1308	1	513 1313	1	513 1313	1	513
