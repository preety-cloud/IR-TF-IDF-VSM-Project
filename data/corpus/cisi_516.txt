Problems in Information Retrieval: Logical Jumps in the Expression of Information .A Farradane, J. Russel, J. M. Yates-Mercer, P. A. In a structured data base, such as that obtained when information is indexed in a format including explicit relations, retrieval of all relevant items in response to a question may, in some cases, be restricted by technicalities of the structure.. Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form of linear or string display.. Nine rules are proposed for condensation of angular structures.. Other type of logical jump and abbreviation are discussed, together with related studies of expansions and inference steps.. .X 124	1	516 125	1	516 160	3	516 165	1	516 175	1	516 257	1	516 258	1	516 263	1	516 381	1	516 388	1	516 448	1	516 452	1	516 477	1	516 478	3	516 484	1	516 511	1	516 516	8	516 518	1	516 521	1	516 522	1	516 523	1	516 526	1	516 527	2	516 528	1	516 529	1	516 572	1	516 575	1	516 610	1	516 615	1	516 625	1	516 626	1	516 636	1	516 666	1	516 700	1	516 705	1	516 707	1	516 727	1	516 754	1	516 758	2	516 785	1	516 812	1	516 817	1	516 824	1	516 875	1	516 1066	1	516 1231	1	516 1259	1	516 1303	1	516 1327	1	516 1364	1	516 1366	1	516 1367	1	516 1368	1	516 1391	1	516 1414	2	516 1428	1	516 1448	2	516 1448	2	516
