Distance between Sets as an Objective Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness .A Heine, M. H. A general measure of retrieval effectiveness having full metric properties and treating the "retrieval system - arbiter of relevance"situation symmetrically, is the Marczewski-Steinhaus metric, D, measuring the distance between the set of relevant documents, A, and set of retrieved documents, B, according to D = 1 -(n (A ^ B)/n(A u B)).. D can be expressed as a function of Presicion and Recall, or of Generality, Fallout and Recall, and of other sets of traditional measures.. Acceptance of the measure allows criteria for retrieval optimality and degeneracy to be stated, defined by minimum and constant  values of D respectively.. Precision_Recall degeneracy curves for D are given and compared with those for another general measure: the probability that a document will be correctly identified by a retrieval system.. Statistical extensions of D are examined, and these and other properties of the metric are illustrated with seven examples.. .X 54	1	519 73	3	519 175	1	519 319	1	519 390	1	519 509	3	519 519	5	519 565	1	519 587	1	519 625	1	519 649	1	519 660	1	519 764	1	519 780	3	519 785	1	519 810	1	519 824	1	519 829	2	519 895	2	519 1091	1	519 1307	3	519 1427	1	519 1427	1	519
