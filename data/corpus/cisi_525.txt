On the Role of Subjectivity in Establishing, Using, Operating and Evaluating Information Retrieval Systems Treatise II on Retrieval System Theory .A Fugman, Robert The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed by subjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. This prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search, particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the methods sufficient for his personal file.. The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of fundamental notions such as "information" and "order".. This gives him a better understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently, even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to make such operations more "objective" and formal.. Such a better mutual understanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of scientific communication.. .X 18	1	525 117	1	525 124	1	525 126	1	525 127	2	525 129	1	525 145	1	525 165	2	525 190	1	525 191	1	525 197	1	525 211	1	525 214	1	525 218	1	525 243	1	525 307	1	525 330	1	525 357	1	525 376	1	525 378	1	525 445	1	525 449	1	525 450	1	525 451	1	525 452	1	525 459	2	525 468	1	525 476	1	525 484	1	525 492	1	525 508	1	525 511	1	525 512	1	525 514	1	525 518	1	525 520	1	525 523	1	525 524	2	525 525	5	525 526	2	525 527	1	525 529	2	525 530	2	525 533	1	525 534	2	525 546	1	525 553	1	525 574	1	525 579	1	525 590	1	525 594	1	525 603	1	525 604	1	525 606	1	525 609	1	525 610	1	525 611	1	525 612	1	525 616	1	525 621	2	525 625	1	525 626	1	525 630	1	525 633	1	525 635	1	525 636	2	525 637	2	525 640	1	525 641	1	525 642	2	525 648	1	525 650	1	525 668	1	525 670	1	525 671	1	525 674	1	525 683	1	525 689	1	525 692	1	525 696	1	525 699	1	525 702	1	525 703	2	525 705	1	525 708	1	525 715	1	525 726	1	525 727	1	525 728	1	525 730	1	525 731	1	525 732	2	525 733	2	525 734	2	525 736	2	525 738	1	525 739	1	525 740	1	525 741	1	525 742	1	525 743	1	525 744	1	525 755	1	525 797	1	525 819	1	525 820	1	525 823	1	525 826	2	525 827	2	525 877	1	525 879	2	525 883	1	525 1004	1	525 1035	1	525 1077	2	525 1078	1	525 1089	1	525 1091	1	525 1207	1	525 1231	2	525 1264	1	525 1297	1	525 1303	1	525 1305	1	525 1306	1	525 1313	1	525 1356	1	525 1364	1	525 1368	1	525 1370	2	525 1372	2	525 1373	1	525 1374	1	525 1375	1	525 1376	1	525 1377	1	525 1383	1	525 1396	1	525 1396	1	525
