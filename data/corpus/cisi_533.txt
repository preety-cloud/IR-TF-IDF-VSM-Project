The Dynamic Scientific-Information User .A Garvey, William D. Tomita, Kazuo Woolf, Patricia In this article we examine the concept of the "information user", and attempt to describe some of the dynamics of the situation by discussing some of our data relative to "intraindividual variations" (changes which occur within individual scientists as their scientific work progresses) and "interindividual variations" (physical vs social scientists, basic vs applied scientists, experienced vs inexperienced scientists, and scientists' working in the same subject-matter area vs scientists who recently changed their areas).. All of these were found to produce significant variation in the information needs of scientists and in the sources they used to satisfy these needs.. Some implications of these findings relative to information technology are discussed.. .X 48	2	533 98	2	533 124	1	533 126	1	533 439	1	533 440	2	533 449	1	533 456	2	533 514	1	533 525	1	533 526	1	533 532	1	533 533	5	533 574	1	533 594	1	533 604	1	533 611	1	533 616	1	533 640	1	533 728	1	533 733	1	533 823	1	533 1303	1	533 1305	1	533 1306	1	533 1313	1	533 1319	1	533 1338	1	533 1338	1	533
