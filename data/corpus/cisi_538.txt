Information Retrieval Systems .A Lancaster, F.W. .B 1972 This book is concerned primarily with those "intellectual" factors that significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems; namely, - indexing policy and practice - vocabulary control - searching control - interaction between the system and its users My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.  I have therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements. The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately covered by other volumes in this series.  Moreover, it is my contention that the importance of "hardware" and "data processing" aspects of information systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment to the performance of many systems. .X 538	6	538 1126	1	538 1139	1	538 1323	1	538 1327	1	538 1411	1	538 1411	1	538
