ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials .A Spalding, C. Sumner At the IFLA Liverpool Conference in 1971 a Joint working Group of the Committees on Cataloguing and on Serial Publications was set up to draw up an International Standard Bibliographic Description for Serials, taking the ISBD(M) as a model in so far as practicable.  As might be expected, the special problems presented by serial publications made the task of developing an ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L. Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier. Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen, Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen- space and dubbing the happy couple the "distinctive title." .X 10	1	541 121	1	541 333	2	541 541	7	541 873	1	541 877	1	541 878	1	541 881	2	541 904	3	541 919	3	541 920	4	541 921	3	541 940	1	541 999	3	541 1000	2	541 1001	3	541 1002	3	541 1003	3	541 1013	1	541 1441	1	541 1441	1	541
