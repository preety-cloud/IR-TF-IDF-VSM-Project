The Nature of Scientific Communication and Influence .A Crane, Diana As the formal communication system of science has become less able to supply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasing attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How are scientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the circulation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes? Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose.. .X 33	1	544 89	2	544 95	2	544 98	1	544 100	1	544 101	1	544 102	1	544 105	4	544 107	1	544 109	1	544 110	1	544 113	1	544 155	1	544 157	1	544 312	1	544 314	1	544 356	2	544 386	2	544 398	1	544 544	5	544 560	3	544 582	1	544 605	1	544 656	1	544 667	1	544 685	1	544 750	1	544 775	1	544 800	1	544 1030	1	544 1050	1	544 1062	1	544 1063	2	544 1081	1	544 1082	1	544 1088	1	544 1256	1	544 1284	2	544 1285	2	544 1286	1	544 1287	1	544 1290	1	544 1291	2	544 1293	1	544 1294	1	544 1295	1	544 1296	1	544 1297	1	544 1300	3	544 1308	1	544 1312	2	544 1313	1	544 1319	1	544 1334	1	544 1345	1	544 1346	2	544 1386	3	544 1408	1	544 1408	1	544
