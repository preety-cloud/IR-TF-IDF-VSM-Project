AIM-TWX - an Experimental On-Line Bibliographic Retrieval System .A Katter, R.V. McCarn, D.B. The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications of the National Library of Medicine, in conjunction with the NLM Library Operations staff, initiated in June 1970 a new experimental service called AIM-TWX (Abridged Index Medicus-TWX) to provide rapid, responsive searching of the medical literature. This experiment is being conducted to identify the need for and usefulness of such services to help medical practitioners situated in isolated areas, to assist in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education, and to provide information precisely when and where it is needed for health care.  A limited group of practitioners, students, and librarians is being given access to the system so that it will not be overloaded and rejected because of busy signals, and so that a variety of user groups can test it. .X 75	1	547 190	1	547 191	1	547 468	1	547 508	1	547 514	1	547 523	2	547 547	6	547 593	1	547 594	2	547 606	1	547 648	1	547 743	1	547 1264	1	547 1303	3	547 1356	1	547 1372	1	547 1372	1	547
