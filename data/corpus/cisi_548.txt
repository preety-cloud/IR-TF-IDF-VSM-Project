The Computer/Library Interface: the Last Five Years .A Balmforth, C.K. Grose, M.W. Jeffreys, A.E. University printing presses exist, and are subsidized by the Government for the purpose of producing books which no one can read; and they are true to their high calling.  Books are the sources of material for lectures.  They should be kept from the young; for to read books and remember what you read, well enough to reproduce it, is called 'cramming', and this is destructive of all true education.  The best way to protect the young from books, is, first, to make them in such a way that no one can find them without several years' training.  A lecturer is a sound scholar, who is chosen to teach on the ground that he was once able to learn.  Eloquence is not permissible in a lecture; it is a privilege reserved by stature for the Public Orator. .X 114	1	548 169	1	548 218	1	548 235	1	548 243	1	548 253	1	548 289	2	548 291	1	548 345	1	548 375	1	548 400	1	548 408	1	548 459	1	548 492	1	548 493	1	548 497	1	548 506	1	548 507	1	548 508	1	548 510	1	548 548	6	548 594	2	548 597	1	548 598	1	548 601	2	548 604	1	548 607	1	548 627	1	548 836	1	548 863	1	548 864	1	548 865	1	548 866	2	548 867	1	548 868	1	548 897	1	548 916	1	548 936	1	548 990	1	548 1042	1	548 1052	1	548 1073	1	548 1087	1	548 1248	1	548 1327	1	548 1368	1	548 1392	1	548 1414	1	548 1448	1	548 1448	1	548
