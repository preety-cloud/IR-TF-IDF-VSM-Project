The Intergroup Conflict .A Sherif, M. In one broad category of theories, the problems are expressed in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they exist in everyday life.  On the whole, theories advanced by many social scientists fall in this broad category.  In this concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously. In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently they are plagued with serious questions of validity. .X 118	1	549 207	1	549 412	1	549 418	1	549 549	5	549 939	1	549 1047	1	549 1332	1	549 1332	1	549
