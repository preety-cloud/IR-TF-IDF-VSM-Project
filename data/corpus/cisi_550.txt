Interlibrary Loan Involving Academic Libraries .A Thomson, S.K. Interlibrary loan transactions involving academic libraries in the United States numbered over 800,000 items in 1963-64.  This number is growing exponentially.  Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third of the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loans are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the usefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loan failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted. .X 14	1	550 153	1	550 170	1	550 223	1	550 266	1	550 271	1	550 550	5	550 1019	1	550 1028	1	550 1086	1	550 1090	1	550 1424	1	550 1424	1	550
