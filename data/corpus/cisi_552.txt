Interlibrary Requests .A Ash, L. Our survey, in other words, is offered within the bounds of descriptive or deductive statistics which seeks to analyze a group, not attempt to estimate the parameters of that population of which the group has been chosen as a sample.  The latter role is assumed by inductive statistics which makes use of probability sampling. Accordingly, our data are presented in those forms and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive statistics: arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories which seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequency of requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested, the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries (university, pharmaceutical, etc.).  The tables are arranged to give evidence of the types of frequency distribution revealed by the Survey, as well as to indicate central tendency, dispersion, rank order, and possibly correlations for significant factors. .X 2	1	552 33	1	552 36	1	552 41	1	552 76	2	552 87	1	552 89	2	552 97	1	552 102	1	552 111	1	552 112	1	552 132	1	552 137	1	552 139	1	552 152	1	552 155	1	552 163	1	552 183	3	552 184	3	552 193	2	552 195	1	552 196	1	552 198	1	552 199	1	552 201	1	552 203	3	552 204	3	552 210	2	552 225	1	552 269	1	552 373	1	552 415	1	552 475	1	552 545	1	552 552	5	552 587	1	552 605	1	552 613	1	552 614	1	552 638	1	552 735	2	552 747	1	552 750	1	552 753	1	552 760	1	552 766	2	552 767	1	552 774	1	552 775	2	552 782	1	552 784	2	552 788	2	552 789	2	552 793	1	552 800	1	552 808	1	552 828	1	552 905	1	552 953	1	552 977	2	552 983	1	552 1016	1	552 1023	1	552 1030	1	552 1055	3	552 1056	1	552 1087	1	552 1090	1	552 1135	1	552 1147	1	552 1260	1	552 1275	1	552 1276	1	552 1278	1	552 1280	1	552 1285	1	552 1286	1	552 1287	1	552 1302	1	552 1335	1	552 1390	1	552 1397	4	552 1417	1	552 1428	1	552 1432	2	552 1451	1	552 1451	1	552
