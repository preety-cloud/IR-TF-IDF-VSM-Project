Introduction to Information Science .A Saracevic, T. The main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoretical and experimental nature rather than on practical applications.  However, the articles selected are viewed as having a considerable potential in two major respects: they have important implications for the practice of information handling, but even more important, they contain aspects of generalization.  The book is oriented toward basic and experimental work, such as that performed by traditional sciences, with the hope that a reader may find much relevant to his own interests, educational level and background, a bridge toward generalizations, a feeling of interconnection between seemingly unrelated works either presented in the book or found in the literature, an awareness of apparent gaps in knowledge, and even ideas for practical solutions or further theoretical or experimental work. .X 72	1	554 75	1	554 149	1	554 161	1	554 175	1	554 197	1	554 201	1	554 224	1	554 287	1	554 298	1	554 348	1	554 375	1	554 381	1	554 382	1	554 408	2	554 444	1	554 445	2	554 447	1	554 449	1	554 454	1	554 456	1	554 458	1	554 472	1	554 503	1	554 506	1	554 507	1	554 514	1	554 523	1	554 532	1	554 535	1	554 554	13	554 575	1	554 579	2	554 584	1	554 591	2	554 593	1	554 594	1	554 595	2	554 596	1	554 597	1	554 599	2	554 600	1	554 603	2	554 604	1	554 606	1	554 608	1	554 615	1	554 619	1	554 620	1	554 621	1	554 625	1	554 630	1	554 654	1	554 723	1	554 724	1	554 752	1	554 762	1	554 780	1	554 801	1	554 805	1	554 806	1	554 822	1	554 836	1	554 851	1	554 856	1	554 857	1	554 858	1	554 859	1	554 860	1	554 861	1	554 862	1	554 866	1	554 867	1	554 907	1	554 956	2	554 961	1	554 989	1	554 1012	1	554 1013	1	554 1035	1	554 1086	1	554 1294	1	554 1298	1	554 1299	1	554 1327	2	554 1405	1	554 1445	1	554 1445	1	554
