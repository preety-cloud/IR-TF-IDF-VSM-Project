Introduction to Systems Philosophy .A Laszlo, E. The general systems theory, pioneered by von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapoport and their collaborators, gives us a theoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientific information and philosophic meaning.  Extended into a general systems philosophy, this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles: by ordering the formerly random segments into a meaningful pattern.  If made good use of, this instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated answers through the cross-fertilization of contemporary science and philosophy. This, then is my credo; the conviction which led to the formulation of the present Introduction to "systems philosophy" over a period of three years of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection. .X 447	1	557 557	5	557 1067	1	557 1069	1	557 1348	1	557 1386	1	557 1386	1	557
