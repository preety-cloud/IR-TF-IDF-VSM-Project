Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics .A Lyons, J. This is a introductory book in the sense that it does not presuppose any previous training in the subject.  But it does assume that the reader - especially the reader whose educational background, like my own, is more in the 'humanities' than in mathematics and 'science' - is prepared to make a certain intellectual effort with respect to the use of symbols and formulae.  Few subjects suffer more than linguistics from the separation of the 'sciences' and the 'humanities' that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools ad universities.  For contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously, and in roughly equal measure, upon the more traditional approach to language that is characteristic of the 'humanities' and the more 'scientific' approach that has developed recently in connection with advances that have been made in formal logic, computer science and automata theory. .X 69	1	558 72	1	558 149	1	558 160	2	558 168	2	558 175	1	558 258	1	558 317	1	558 320	1	558 324	1	558 388	1	558 477	1	558 479	1	558 558	8	558 566	1	558 572	1	558 600	2	558 628	2	558 653	1	558 746	1	558 761	1	558 781	1	558 795	1	558 901	1	558 1046	2	558 1118	1	558 1202	1	558 1218	1	558 1309	1	558 1394	1	558 1399	2	558 1422	1	558 1443	1	558 1443	1	558
