A Dynamic Programming Approach to R and D Budgeting and Project Selection .A Hess, Sidney W. Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time between a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable investment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods.. The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or unconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice.. Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit their practical application are discussed.. .X 349	1	561 423	6	561 424	5	561 425	5	561 426	1	561 427	1	561 428	2	561 436	1	561 437	1	561 561	9	561 1036	1	561 1039	2	561 1040	2	561 1449	1	561 1449	1	561
