The Association Factor in Information Retrieval .A Stiles, H. Edmund This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact terms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of their relevance to the request.. The key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and arranged in the order of their relevance to the request.. .X 26	3	562 45	1	562 78	1	562 174	1	562 175	2	562 179	1	562 315	1	562 321	1	562 363	1	562 419	3	562 420	1	562 421	1	562 422	1	562 458	1	562 479	1	562 485	1	562 562	7	562 564	3	562 566	2	562 570	1	562 659	1	562 660	3	562 661	1	562 662	2	562 663	2	562 664	3	562 769	1	562 785	1	562 1044	1	562 1087	1	562 1144	1	562 1154	1	562 1218	2	562 1279	1	562 1327	1	562 1327	1	562
