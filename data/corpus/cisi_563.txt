A Study of Methods for Systematically Abbreviating English Words and Names .A Bourne, Charles P. .A Ford, Donald F. This study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating English words and names.. Most of the attention was given to the techniques which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose digital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process incoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no table lookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described.. In addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand subject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a quantitative measure of comparison.. .X 19	1	563 228	1	563 318	1	563 321	1	563 324	1	563 329	1	563 331	1	563 416	1	563 442	1	563 450	1	563 495	2	563 511	1	563 524	1	563 563	6	563 565	1	563 567	1	563 703	1	563 739	1	563 835	4	563 851	4	563 862	2	563 875	1	563 1053	1	563 1194	1	563 1199	1	563 1199	1	563
