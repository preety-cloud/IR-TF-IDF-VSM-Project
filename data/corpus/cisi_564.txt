Automatic Document Classification .A Borko, Harold .A Bernick, Myrna Starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing with computers, the experiment in automatic document classification proceeds to construct an empirically based, mathematically derived classification system by use of a factor analysis technique.. The documents are then classified into these derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated.. Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or 48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of classification categories and a different computational formula.. The experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification technique.. .X 26	2	564 28	1	564 42	1	564 45	2	564 72	1	564 79	1	564 174	2	564 175	1	564 179	1	564 310	1	564 315	1	564 419	2	564 420	1	564 421	1	564 422	2	564 454	1	564 458	1	564 464	1	564 479	2	564 483	1	564 485	2	564 509	1	564 562	3	564 564	7	564 565	1	564 566	2	564 570	1	564 660	2	564 661	3	564 662	4	564 663	4	564 664	2	564 714	1	564 769	2	564 785	1	564 853	1	564 1044	1	564 1117	1	564 1140	1	564 1144	1	564 1154	1	564 1218	1	564 1279	1	564 1327	1	564 1419	1	564 1419	1	564
