The Application of Pattern Recognition to Screening Prospective Anticancer Drugs .A Kowalski, B.R. Pattern recognition has been introduced to the chemical literature as a general tool which can be used by the chemist to reduce masses of experimental data to relevant information.  Perhaps more importantly, it provides connections between raw, multivariant data and sought-for information without making restrictive assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data. The general problem has been stated as follows.  Given a collection of objects and a list of measurements made on each object, is it possible to find and/or predict a property of the objects that is not directly measurable but is known to be related to the measurements via some unknown relationship?  The only assumption made is that similarities and dissimilarities among objects are reflected in at least some of the measurements. .X 254	2	568 327	3	568 568	6	568 697	1	568 700	1	568 706	2	568 890	4	568 1092	4	568 1202	1	568 1452	1	568 1452	1	568
