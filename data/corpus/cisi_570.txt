Deriving Term Relations for a Corpus by Graph Theoretical Clusters .A Augustson, J.G. Minker, J. We discuss how alternative methods of automatic term clustering may provide insight into how terms are related within a corpus.  The work reported uses a corpus of 2267 documents that contain 3950 index terms.	A similarity matrix is developed using the document - term matrix.  A threshold level T is applied to the similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that are greater than or equal to the threshold level are set equal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero. Three definitions are applied to the corresponding graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters. These are, (1) the connected components of the graph, (2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and (3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the graph as described that show how insight may be gained into the term relations by varying the threshold levels and the cluster definitions. .X 77	1	570 79	1	570 86	1	570 168	1	570 175	3	570 176	1	570 317	1	570 320	1	570 382	2	570 389	1	570 390	1	570 422	1	570 458	1	570 479	1	570 485	1	570 488	3	570 489	1	570 493	1	570 498	1	570 499	1	570 514	1	570 520	1	570 562	1	570 564	1	570 566	1	570 570	5	570 576	1	570 581	1	570 586	1	570 596	1	570 608	1	570 636	1	570 643	1	570 659	2	570 660	1	570 785	1	570 790	1	570 820	1	570 894	1	570 1044	1	570 1154	1	570 1218	1	570 1294	1	570 1313	1	570 1327	1	570 1419	1	570 1443	1	570 1443	1	570
