Automatic Abstracting and Indexing.. II. Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual Inference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria .A Rush, J. E. Salvador, R. Zamora, A. Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods of the automatic abstracting system is warranted.. .X 26	1	571 35	3	571 43	1	571 68	1	571 84	1	571 175	1	571 315	1	571 324	1	571 420	3	571 499	2	571 571	6	571 657	2	571 664	1	571 666	2	571 712	1	571 1054	1	571 1281	1	571 1281	1	571
