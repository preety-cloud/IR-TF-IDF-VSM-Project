Overlap in the Lists of Journals Monitored by Biosis, CAS, and Ei .A Wood, James L. Flanagan, Carolyn Kennedy, H. E. In April 1970, the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Engineering Index, Inc. began a five-part study to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage in their printed publications and computer-readable services.. This study was designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policies and practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to their user communities.. This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the 14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of the services, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the study will determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within the journals.. .X 4	1	580 18	1	580 65	1	580 91	1	580 125	2	580 127	1	580 129	1	580 145	1	580 162	1	580 211	1	580 243	1	580 253	1	580 363	1	580 378	1	580 421	1	580 432	1	580 439	1	580 440	2	580 452	1	580 453	1	580 460	1	580 461	1	580 467	1	580 468	1	580 495	1	580 506	1	580 508	1	580 511	1	580 512	1	580 514	1	580 517	1	580 520	1	580 521	1	580 523	1	580 524	1	580 526	1	580 528	1	580 576	1	580 580	16	580 604	2	580 609	2	580 612	1	580 619	1	580 622	6	580 623	1	580 629	1	580 631	1	580 632	1	580 633	1	580 642	1	580 643	1	580 644	1	580 645	1	580 646	1	580 649	1	580 650	1	580 696	2	580 699	1	580 700	1	580 705	2	580 707	1	580 708	1	580 723	1	580 726	1	580 727	2	580 728	2	580 729	2	580 730	1	580 731	1	580 736	1	580 737	1	580 738	1	580 739	1	580 741	1	580 754	1	580 770	1	580 776	1	580 809	1	580 812	1	580 813	2	580 814	1	580 820	1	580 822	1	580 866	1	580 870	2	580 873	1	580 981	1	580 1078	1	580 1089	1	580 1091	1	580 1143	1	580 1208	1	580 1264	1	580 1298	1	580 1302	1	580 1303	1	580 1366	1	580 1367	1	580 1368	1	580 1374	1	580 1376	1	580 1396	2	580 1396	2	580
