Structure and Effectiveness of The Citation Identifier, an Operational Computer Program for Automatic Identification of Case Citations in Legal Literature .A Borkowski, Casimir Cepanec, Louis Martin, J. Sperling Salko, Virginia Treu, Siegfried A computer program for automatic identification of "full form" case citations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall. 220, 18 L. Ed. 343; Southland Industries, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developed by this group and is now operational.. The level of performance of this program known as "The Citation Identifier" is high.. In a recent computer run, The Citation Identifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions of U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227 (that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and three false drops occurred.. Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) were identified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which some citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program ("short hits"); and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly included in the citations ("long hits"). Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible and can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program.. The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run, the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text was approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increased by suitable changes in the computer program.. An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g., "the Geddes decision", "the Southland Industries case") is now in preparation.. .X 30	1	581 38	1	581 51	1	581 69	1	581 71	2	581 75	1	581 77	3	581 78	1	581 79	3	581 80	1	581 81	1	581 82	1	581 83	1	581 84	1	581 154	1	581 168	2	581 175	1	581 176	1	581 212	1	581 247	1	581 315	2	581 317	1	581 320	1	581 382	1	581 420	1	581 448	1	581 480	1	581 483	1	581 484	1	581 486	1	581 488	3	581 489	2	581 490	2	581 491	3	581 492	2	581 493	3	581 494	1	581 495	1	581 496	2	581 497	2	581 498	2	581 499	3	581 500	1	581 503	1	581 507	1	581 509	1	581 510	1	581 512	1	581 517	1	581 520	1	581 522	1	581 527	1	581 528	1	581 531	1	581 565	1	581 566	1	581 570	1	581 581	6	581 583	1	581 584	1	581 586	1	581 596	1	581 603	1	581 608	1	581 633	1	581 659	3	581 666	2	581 715	1	581 754	1	581 790	2	581 795	1	581 801	1	581 805	1	581 809	1	581 810	1	581 812	1	581 813	1	581 814	1	581 817	1	581 824	1	581 825	1	581 838	1	581 853	1	581 894	1	581 986	1	581 1035	1	581 1051	1	581 1294	4	581 1327	1	581 1393	1	581 1419	1	581 1427	1	581 1431	1	581 1443	1	581 1443	1	581
