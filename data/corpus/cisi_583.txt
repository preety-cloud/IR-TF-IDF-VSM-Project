Evaluation of a KWIC Index for Library Literature .A Brodie, N.E. A librarian attempting to do a literature search currently faces an eight-month gap in access to the literature of his field through Library Literature.  In April 1968, librarians made a rare examination of their own literature and considered this gap and other information problems in librarianship.  The Albany Conference on the Bibliographic Control of Library Science Literature recommended the establishment of a fast announcement service for library schools (1).  A monthly Keyword in Context (KWIC) index serving the whole range of information-oriented professions was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference group to meet the need for current information (2). .X 38	3	583 84	1	583 159	2	583 162	1	583 175	1	583 257	1	583 348	1	583 382	1	583 429	2	583 488	1	583 489	2	583 490	1	583 491	1	583 492	1	583 493	2	583 494	1	583 495	1	583 496	1	583 497	1	583 498	1	583 499	1	583 500	1	583 501	1	583 565	1	583 581	1	583 582	2	583 583	8	583 584	1	583 585	1	583 586	2	583 608	1	583 653	1	583 655	2	583 659	1	583 688	1	583 749	1	583 795	1	583 796	1	583 797	2	583 798	2	583 799	1	583 801	2	583 802	1	583 858	1	583 859	1	583 861	1	583 986	1	583 1027	1	583 1144	1	583 1294	2	583 1327	1	583 1405	1	583 1405	1	583
