The Practice of Charging Users for Information Services: A State of the Art Report .A Penner, Rudolf J. The state of the art literature review disclosed that society has not yet come to the point that paying for library information services is a common thing.. It was also found that a sound basis for determining the costs of the services - let alone charge for them - does not exist: While some data on specific cost for unit operations are available, it is very difficult to compare the data and arrive at meaningful figures.. Nevertheless, there is an indication that large operating centers are becoming concerned with cost to the point that they are cost-according their operations, which would permit them to establish realistic fees for their services.. .X 27	1	584 38	1	584 39	1	584 67	1	584 74	3	584 76	1	584 83	4	584 84	1	584 95	1	584 104	1	584 110	1	584 120	1	584 158	1	584 161	1	584 279	1	584 287	1	584 292	1	584 348	1	584 408	1	584 488	1	584 489	1	584 490	2	584 491	2	584 492	2	584 493	1	584 494	1	584 495	2	584 496	2	584 497	2	584 499	1	584 500	1	584 554	1	584 581	1	584 582	1	584 583	1	584 584	8	584 586	1	584 589	1	584 591	2	584 606	1	584 654	1	584 655	1	584 659	1	584 795	1	584 801	1	584 851	1	584 856	1	584 857	1	584 858	1	584 859	1	584 860	1	584 861	1	584 862	1	584 986	1	584 1012	1	584 1013	1	584 1035	1	584 1187	1	584 1287	1	584 1294	1	584 1297	1	584 1300	1	584 1359	1	584 1360	1	584 1445	1	584 1445	1	584
