Towards a Metascience of Information:  Informatology .A Otten, Klaus .A Debons, Anthony Arguments are advanced to suggest that information and operations on information are phenomena, the principles of which provide the basis for a metascience of information  (informatology).. The fundamental character of the phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and communication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by several factors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information- oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied, a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned in some form or other with information on one side and man's relationship to the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascience of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems for which the science has to provide answers and solutions.. It is suggested that an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of information be developed and implemented.. .X 20	1	585 42	1	585 60	1	585 85	2	585 129	1	585 159	1	585 172	1	585 175	1	585 313	1	585 348	1	585 420	1	585 469	1	585 540	1	585 583	1	585 585	9	585 592	1	585 593	1	585 595	1	585 599	1	585 640	1	585 652	1	585 655	1	585 665	1	585 762	1	585 797	1	585 798	1	585 799	1	585 803	2	585 858	1	585 859	1	585 861	1	585 1022	2	585 1045	1	585 1169	2	585 1268	1	585 1309	1	585 1386	1	585 1423	1	585 1459	1	585 1459	1	585
