Cardiovascular Serial Literature: Characteristics, Productive Journals, and Abstracting/Indexing Coverage .A Frick, Barbara F. .A Ginski, John M. Two groups of journals were identified as potential sources for cardiovascular (c-v) information.. The first group consists of 78 c-v specialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title.. These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty journals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of the National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings.. In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported to NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S. c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the most quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14% of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v journals.. The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking journals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals.. .X 33	1	588 36	1	588 90	1	588 91	1	588 161	1	588 183	1	588 184	1	588 193	1	588 198	1	588 199	1	588 201	1	588 202	1	588 203	1	588 204	1	588 205	1	588 209	1	588 212	1	588 217	1	588 220	1	588 222	1	588 284	1	588 286	1	588 294	1	588 379	1	588 429	1	588 513	1	588 543	1	588 582	1	588 588	6	588 589	1	588 603	1	588 613	3	588 614	1	588 616	1	588 618	1	588 624	1	588 657	1	588 685	2	588 686	1	588 691	1	588 721	1	588 722	1	588 724	1	588 725	1	588 735	1	588 775	1	588 793	1	588 799	1	588 800	1	588 808	1	588 821	1	588 958	1	588 959	1	588 987	1	588 988	1	588 1010	1	588 1086	1	588 1087	1	588 1151	1	588 1208	1	588 1275	1	588 1283	1	588 1290	1	588 1293	1	588 1302	2	588 1355	1	588 1355	1	588
