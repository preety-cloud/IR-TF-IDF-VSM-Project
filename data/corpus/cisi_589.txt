Are Titles of Chemical Papers Becoming More Informative? .A Tocatlian, Jacques J. The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titles for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services, such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as "carriers" of information.. The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958.. The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958, and 1968.. Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the KWIC index.. .X 35	1	589 38	2	589 42	1	589 43	1	589 52	3	589 53	1	589 70	1	589 73	1	589 76	1	589 81	1	589 88	1	589 89	1	589 91	1	589 95	2	589 104	1	589 110	1	589 150	4	589 161	1	589 175	2	589 384	1	589 390	1	589 420	1	589 429	2	589 503	2	589 510	1	589 513	1	589 517	1	589 560	1	589 576	2	589 578	1	589 582	5	589 584	1	589 588	1	589 589	14	589 594	1	589 595	1	589 603	3	589 613	1	589 614	1	589 618	1	589 655	2	589 656	1	589 657	4	589 685	1	589 686	1	589 691	1	589 711	1	589 721	1	589 722	4	589 724	1	589 725	1	589 820	1	589 830	1	589 958	1	589 987	1	589 988	1	589 1054	1	589 1089	1	589 1144	2	589 1154	1	589 1195	3	589 1208	1	589 1232	1	589 1256	1	589 1281	2	589 1287	1	589 1293	1	589 1295	1	589 1297	1	589 1298	1	589 1300	1	589 1302	1	589 1421	1	589 1421	1	589
