Toward a Theory of Indexing--II .A Landry, Bertrand C. .A Rush, James E. The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a theory of information storage and retrieval.. It is believed that this theory can best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing.. After stating basic premises and defining essential concepts, the relationship between a theory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is considered.. The similarities between the indexing process and the general communication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order increasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoretical index is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems.. The relationship between query formulation, retrieval, and benefit is discussed, and these notions are then related to the human performance variable.  It is believed that the ideas presented in this paper provide a useful framework for more detailed investigations into the indexing process.. .X 29	1	590 58	2	590 68	1	590 117	3	590 165	2	590 168	1	590 320	1	590 445	2	590 451	1	590 476	1	590 525	1	590 572	2	590 590	5	590 609	1	590 621	1	590 656	1	590 664	1	590 668	1	590 670	1	590 671	1	590 674	1	590 683	2	590 689	3	590 715	1	590 762	1	590 797	1	590 814	1	590 819	1	590 901	1	590 1045	1	590 1046	2	590 1047	1	590 1077	2	590 1213	1	590 1231	2	590 1389	1	590 1443	2	590 1443	2	590
