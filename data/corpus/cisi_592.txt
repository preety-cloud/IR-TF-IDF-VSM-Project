Some Remarks on Elitism in Information and the Invisible College Phenomenon in Science .A De Solla Price, D.J. Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins' Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher who composed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics with the aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which contained absolutely no information on that subject. The technique used, we are told with a nudge of superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to combine the information. I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific Information is just some special variety of information that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate, pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose too that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be full of scientific books, and that the best possible technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a library qualification and combined it with the appropriate sort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used to say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical compound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there is more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage and retrieval of information, and there is about science and technology something intrinsically different from mere scholarship. .X 15	1	592 19	1	592 32	1	592 55	1	592 74	1	592 83	1	592 103	1	592 105	1	592 110	1	592 111	1	592 113	1	592 161	1	592 163	1	592 175	1	592 243	1	592 245	1	592 255	1	592 273	1	592 279	1	592 288	1	592 331	1	592 356	1	592 381	1	592 408	1	592 475	1	592 490	1	592 496	1	592 545	1	592 560	1	592 585	1	592 591	1	592 592	9	592 593	1	592 595	1	592 602	1	592 607	1	592 716	1	592 723	1	592 724	1	592 735	1	592 747	1	592 777	1	592 791	2	592 834	1	592 860	1	592 893	1	592 925	1	592 957	1	592 976	1	592 1030	2	592 1062	1	592 1085	1	592 1087	1	592 1089	1	592 1148	1	592 1200	1	592 1209	1	592 1227	1	592 1285	1	592 1291	1	592 1293	2	592 1296	1	592 1298	2	592 1309	1	592 1317	1	592 1337	1	592 1338	1	592 1346	1	592 1347	1	592 1353	1	592 1359	1	592 1360	1	592 1400	1	592 1410	1	592 1424	1	592 1424	1	592
