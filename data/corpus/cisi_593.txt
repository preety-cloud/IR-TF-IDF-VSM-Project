Human Factors in the Design of an Interactive Library System .A McAllister, Caryl Bell, John M. ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimental system for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360 through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handle large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations.. At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills of a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained librarians.. Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical of large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper discusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove useful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display format, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability for the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter mnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line numbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of default conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification; and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system.. .X 66	1	593 78	1	593 161	1	593 175	1	593 197	2	593 218	1	593 332	1	593 375	1	593 445	1	593 454	1	593 472	1	593 503	1	593 506	1	593 507	1	593 546	1	593 547	1	593 554	1	593 579	1	593 585	1	593 591	1	593 592	1	593 593	5	593 594	2	593 595	2	593 596	1	593 597	1	593 599	1	593 600	1	593 603	1	593 604	1	593 606	2	593 723	1	593 724	1	593 801	1	593 805	1	593 806	1	593 836	1	593 866	1	593 867	1	593 956	1	593 989	1	593 1035	1	593 1298	1	593 1299	1	593 1309	1	593 1327	1	593 1405	1	593 1405	1	593
