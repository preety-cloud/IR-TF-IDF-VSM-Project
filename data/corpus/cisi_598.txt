Curricula in Information Science:  Analysis and Development .A Belzer, J Isaac, A Finkelstein, E. Williams, J. The Curriculum Committee of the Special Interest Group/Education Information Science of ASIS is charged with the responsibility for determining the scope and characteristics of information science programs in the US and Canada in terms of Curriculum developments and course offerings.  To fulfill this responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicit reliable information concerning courses being offered relating to information storage and retrieval, information science and/or documentation.  The data requested included course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses, textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with which offered, etc. Responses were received from 45 schools, providing information about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Using several methods of clustering the data, it was difficult to arrive at firm results, because of the diversity and scatter of the topics included in this field.  It was therefore decided to hold a workshop of experts which would examine the validity of the questionnaire results. This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arrive at consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburgh on September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in the field representing universities industry and government were brought together to participate.  Consensus was reached in identifying nine factors which contribute to the curriculum in information science and seven courses which constitute the core for the Master's program. The topics to be included in each of these courses were also isolated. .X 5	1	598 217	1	598 235	1	598 243	1	598 249	1	598 289	1	598 291	1	598 364	1	598 385	1	598 459	1	598 505	1	598 535	1	598 548	1	598 553	1	598 594	2	598 597	1	598 598	8	598 601	1	598 779	1	598 836	1	598 863	1	598 864	1	598 865	1	598 866	1	598 868	1	598 885	1	598 897	1	598 916	1	598 936	1	598 972	1	598 1052	1	598 1166	1	598 1248	1	598 1403	1	598 1403	1	598
