Compound Words: A Problem in Post-Coordinate Retrieval Systems .A Jones, Kevin P. Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexing systems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selected for fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval.. Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which include those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes.. The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components, and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form.. These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA) for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent.. It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the application of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinate basis.. .X 63	1	600 160	1	600 161	1	600 175	2	600 197	1	600 348	1	600 375	1	600 389	1	600 390	1	600 445	1	600 454	1	600 472	1	600 477	1	600 487	1	600 502	1	600 503	1	600 506	1	600 507	1	600 554	1	600 558	2	600 579	2	600 591	1	600 593	1	600 594	1	600 595	1	600 596	2	600 597	1	600 599	1	600 600	5	600 601	1	600 603	1	600 604	1	600 606	1	600 653	2	600 723	1	600 724	1	600 746	1	600 781	1	600 799	1	600 801	1	600 805	2	600 806	1	600 807	1	600 836	1	600 863	1	600 864	1	600 866	1	600 867	1	600 901	1	600 956	2	600 963	1	600 987	1	600 988	1	600 989	2	600 1152	1	600 1265	1	600 1294	1	600 1298	1	600 1299	1	600 1327	2	600 1394	1	600 1405	1	600 1414	1	600 1422	1	600 1422	1	600
