Improving a Field-based "Eric-Like" Information System .A Paisley, W. This is a period for rapid growth in information systems for the sciences and professions.  Information centers are springing up across the country.  Federal agencies and private groups are both collaborating and competing to establish comprehensive systems. Changing the library's name to "information center" is more than linguistic faddism.  New, active roles subordinate the library's traditional, passive role as a preserver and codifier of knowledge.  "Information center" bears analogy to "economic center" and "transportation center."  Like these centers, its significance is in transaction.  The significance of a transportation center lies in routes to other centers.  The significance of an information center lies in communication lines to knowledge producers and knowledge users.  Information centers are judged by their information "throughput," not by their "holdings." .X 91	1	607 105	1	607 111	1	607 113	1	607 161	1	607 163	1	607 218	1	607 243	2	607 253	1	607 345	1	607 356	1	607 375	3	607 406	1	607 408	1	607 456	1	607 492	1	607 497	1	607 506	1	607 507	1	607 508	1	607 510	1	607 545	1	607 548	1	607 560	1	607 592	1	607 594	1	607 601	1	607 602	1	607 604	1	607 607	5	607 725	1	607 803	1	607 866	1	607 867	1	607 1030	1	607 1042	1	607 1057	1	607 1087	1	607 1293	1	607 1296	1	607 1298	1	607 1327	1	607 1346	1	607 1347	1	607 1364	1	607 1364	1	607
