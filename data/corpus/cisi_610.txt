The Development of a Semantic Differential to Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive Reference Retrieval System .A Katzer, Jeffrey A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest.. To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system.. Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled "evaluative-specific" and accounted for over 23% of the total variance.. Factor II was called "desirability"; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled "enormity" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading.. In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions.. Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD.. The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure and the need for a predicative replication of the study.. .X 90	1	610 124	3	610 125	1	610 127	1	610 129	1	610 165	1	610 190	1	610 191	1	610 197	1	610 211	1	610 214	1	610 218	1	610 231	1	610 243	1	610 261	1	610 295	1	610 299	1	610 307	1	610 330	1	610 334	1	610 343	1	610 354	1	610 378	1	610 381	1	610 417	1	610 448	1	610 450	1	610 451	1	610 452	2	610 459	1	610 468	1	610 484	2	610 492	1	610 508	1	610 511	2	610 512	1	610 514	2	610 516	1	610 518	2	610 520	1	610 521	1	610 522	1	610 523	2	610 524	1	610 525	1	610 526	2	610 527	1	610 528	1	610 529	2	610 530	1	610 534	1	610 546	2	610 553	1	610 575	1	610 579	1	610 586	1	610 591	1	610 594	1	610 597	1	610 603	2	610 604	1	610 606	2	610 608	2	610 609	1	610 610	9	610 611	2	610 612	3	610 615	1	610 617	1	610 620	1	610 625	2	610 626	3	610 630	1	610 636	2	610 637	1	610 642	1	610 648	1	610 650	1	610 692	1	610 696	1	610 699	1	610 700	1	610 703	1	610 705	2	610 707	1	610 708	1	610 726	1	610 727	2	610 728	1	610 731	1	610 732	1	610 733	1	610 734	1	610 736	1	610 738	1	610 739	1	610 740	1	610 741	1	610 742	1	610 743	1	610 744	1	610 754	1	610 755	1	610 812	1	610 815	1	610 817	1	610 820	1	610 824	1	610 826	1	610 827	1	610 875	1	610 879	1	610 883	1	610 938	1	610 939	1	610 986	1	610 991	1	610 992	1	610 1004	1	610 1035	1	610 1047	1	610 1078	1	610 1089	1	610 1091	1	610 1207	1	610 1221	1	610 1264	1	610 1297	1	610 1303	3	610 1318	1	610 1327	1	610 1356	1	610 1364	2	610 1365	1	610 1366	1	610 1367	1	610 1368	2	610 1370	1	610 1372	1	610 1373	1	610 1374	1	610 1375	1	610 1376	1	610 1377	1	610 1387	1	610 1390	1	610 1390	1	610
