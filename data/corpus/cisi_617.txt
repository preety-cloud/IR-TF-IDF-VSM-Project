On-Line  Serials Control System in a Large Biomedical Library; 1) Description of the System .A Fayollat, James An on-line serials control system with particular emphasis on storage and maintenance concepts is described.. The system, operational since January, 1971, has evolved from a former batch card system and remains completely compatible with it.. The system allows real-time display and updating of all elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claims operations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplished on a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is an IBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applications programs, and IBM 2260 display units.. This article is the first of three.. The second is concerned with an analysis of inverted file retrieval features and the third compares the operation of the on-line with the batch system, comparable manual operations, and discusses costs.. .X 90	2	617 200	1	617 231	1	617 261	1	617 289	1	617 294	1	617 295	1	617 299	1	617 334	1	617 354	1	617 553	1	617 608	1	617 610	1	617 612	1	617 617	6	617 620	5	617 815	1	617 872	1	617 938	1	617 939	1	617 963	1	617 990	1	617 991	1	617 992	1	617 1221	2	617 1229	1	617 1318	1	617 1365	1	617 1390	1	617 1390	1	617
