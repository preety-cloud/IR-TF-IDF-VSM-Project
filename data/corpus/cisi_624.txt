Clinician Search for Information .A Friedlander, Janet The use of a medical library by members of the faculty of a medical school was studied by questionnaire in an effort to ascertain the part the library played, among channels of communication, in work-related information searches.. The study described the population of users and the kinds of sources they utilized in an information search, in an effort to identify the factors influencing their choice of kinds of sources and leading to the possibility of predicting use of kinds of source once the characteristics of the users were known.. It brought out a high use of sources which are accessible and easy to use.. The tabulations show the importance of co-workers in informal communication.. Low delegation of documentation tasks to libraries was apparent.. The main user of the library studied was a clinician in the area of internal medicine who used journal articles about diseases for information to use in the treatment of his patients.. The recommendations were made that journals should be shelved accessibly, with Index Medicus nearby.. Books might be shelved less accessibly.. Telephone access to the library is of major importance as is the provision of adequate photocopying facilities.. .X 33	1	624 36	1	624 90	1	624 95	1	624 161	3	624 183	1	624 184	1	624 193	1	624 199	1	624 201	1	624 202	1	624 203	1	624 204	1	624 205	1	624 209	1	624 212	1	624 217	1	624 220	1	624 222	1	624 284	1	624 286	1	624 294	1	624 295	1	624 300	2	624 358	1	624 433	1	624 439	1	624 528	1	624 543	1	624 588	1	624 613	1	624 614	1	624 624	6	624 631	1	624 772	1	624 799	1	624 800	1	624 808	1	624 818	1	624 937	1	624 946	1	624 959	1	624 1151	1	624 1353	1	624 1361	1	624 1373	1	624 1373	1	624
