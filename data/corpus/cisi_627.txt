Theoretical Foundations of Thesaurus-Construction and Some Methodological Considerations for Thesaurus-Updating .A Kim, Chai It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenance rules and conventions are not theoretically based.. For this reason, there are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and retrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature ("one-way" communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication ("both-way" communication).. The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts of meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating of a thesaurus.. .X 114	2	627 141	1	627 154	1	627 169	1	627 194	1	627 212	1	627 289	1	627 299	2	627 333	2	627 345	1	627 400	1	627 458	1	627 459	1	627 493	1	627 522	1	627 530	1	627 548	1	627 627	5	627 628	2	627 770	1	627 796	1	627 802	1	627 873	1	627 874	2	627 875	2	627 876	1	627 892	2	627 941	2	627 990	1	627 994	1	627 995	2	627 996	1	627 997	1	627 998	1	627 1073	1	627 1079	2	627 1153	1	627 1189	1	627 1251	1	627 1351	2	627 1368	1	627 1392	2	627 1396	1	627 1414	1	627 1420	2	627 1431	1	627 1434	2	627 1435	2	627 1442	2	627 1448	2	627 1448	2	627
