The Environment of Classification: The Concept of Mutual Exclusivity .A Jones, Kevin P. It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage of alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its philosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the observable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem.. Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an integrated approach to problems.. .X 72	1	628 141	1	628 160	1	628 299	2	628 333	3	628 449	1	628 522	1	628 530	2	628 553	1	628 558	2	628 572	1	628 627	2	628 628	5	628 795	1	628 802	1	628 819	1	628 873	1	628 874	3	628 875	2	628 876	1	628 877	1	628 878	1	628 892	2	628 940	1	628 941	3	628 992	1	628 993	1	628 994	1	628 995	3	628 996	1	628 997	1	628 998	1	628 1046	1	628 1079	3	628 1153	1	628 1189	1	628 1202	1	628 1216	1	628 1218	1	628 1251	1	628 1351	2	628 1396	1	628 1399	1	628 1420	2	628 1421	1	628 1434	3	628 1435	3	628 1436	1	628 1442	2	628 1442	2	628
