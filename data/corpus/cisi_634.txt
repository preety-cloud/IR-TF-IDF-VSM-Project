On Selecting A Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness Part II. Implementation of the Philosophy .A Cooper,  William S. It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the best way to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicit subjective estimates of the system's utility to its users, quantified in terms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willing to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naive methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis.. But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions:	How can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in terms of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from the naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it by experimentation.. .X 9	1	634 57	1	634 73	1	634 120	1	634 123	1	634 131	1	634 167	1	634 197	1	634 207	1	634 222	1	634 223	1	634 274	1	634 296	1	634 297	1	634 298	1	634 300	1	634 301	1	634 302	1	634 358	1	634 359	1	634 364	1	634 382	1	634 390	1	634 445	1	634 449	1	634 468	1	634 506	1	634 515	1	634 518	2	634 523	1	634 531	1	634 535	1	634 577	1	634 625	7	634 629	1	634 630	1	634 631	1	634 634	9	634 643	1	634 644	1	634 649	1	634 652	1	634 660	1	634 696	1	634 705	1	634 736	1	634 748	1	634 752	1	634 754	1	634 756	1	634 780	1	634 785	1	634 791	2	634 795	1	634 804	1	634 810	1	634 811	1	634 812	2	634 814	1	634 816	1	634 818	1	634 823	1	634 826	1	634 829	1	634 830	1	634 843	1	634 844	1	634 846	1	634 895	1	634 915	1	634 961	1	634 962	1	634 964	1	634 994	1	634 1015	1	634 1019	1	634 1037	1	634 1242	1	634 1247	1	634 1268	1	634 1282	1	634 1327	1	634 1354	1	634 1354	1	634
