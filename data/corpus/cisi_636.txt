Text Searching Retrieval of Answer-Sentences and Other Answer-Passages .A O'Connor, John Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasions determined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, "answer-passages" are retrieved.. An "answer-passage" is a passage which is either answer-providing or "answer-indicative," i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening "syntactic joints" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well.. The computer uses "enclosure" and "connector words" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers.. In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results.. The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a "soft science," and it is reasonable to hope that in less "soft" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted.. .X 18	1	636 75	1	636 86	1	636 124	2	636 125	1	636 127	2	636 129	1	636 145	1	636 165	1	636 175	1	636 190	1	636 191	1	636 197	1	636 211	1	636 214	1	636 218	1	636 243	1	636 307	1	636 330	1	636 357	1	636 376	1	636 378	1	636 381	1	636 382	1	636 389	1	636 390	1	636 448	1	636 450	1	636 451	1	636 452	2	636 459	2	636 468	1	636 484	2	636 492	1	636 508	1	636 511	2	636 512	1	636 514	3	636 516	1	636 518	2	636 520	2	636 521	1	636 522	1	636 523	2	636 524	2	636 525	2	636 526	2	636 527	2	636 528	1	636 529	3	636 530	2	636 534	2	636 546	1	636 553	1	636 570	1	636 575	1	636 576	1	636 579	1	636 586	1	636 594	1	636 603	1	636 604	1	636 606	1	636 608	1	636 609	2	636 610	2	636 611	1	636 612	1	636 615	1	636 625	2	636 626	2	636 630	1	636 633	1	636 635	1	636 636	6	636 637	2	636 642	2	636 643	1	636 648	1	636 650	1	636 659	1	636 692	1	636 696	1	636 699	1	636 700	1	636 702	1	636 703	2	636 705	2	636 707	1	636 708	1	636 726	2	636 727	2	636 728	1	636 730	1	636 731	1	636 732	2	636 733	2	636 734	2	636 736	2	636 738	1	636 739	1	636 740	1	636 741	1	636 742	1	636 743	1	636 744	1	636 754	1	636 755	1	636 812	1	636 817	1	636 820	2	636 824	1	636 826	2	636 827	2	636 875	1	636 877	1	636 879	2	636 883	1	636 894	1	636 1004	1	636 1035	1	636 1078	1	636 1089	1	636 1091	1	636 1207	1	636 1264	1	636 1294	1	636 1297	1	636 1303	2	636 1313	1	636 1327	2	636 1356	1	636 1364	2	636 1366	1	636 1367	1	636 1368	2	636 1370	2	636 1372	2	636 1373	1	636 1374	1	636 1375	1	636 1376	1	636 1377	1	636 1383	1	636 1396	1	636 1419	1	636 1419	1	636
