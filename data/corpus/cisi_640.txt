The Scientific Premises of Information Science .A Rosenberg, Victor Throughout my years of work as an information scientist I have been plagued by a personal and professional sense of doubt with respect to the field.. A central theme of every conference that I have attended related to:  "What is information science?" Or "Is information science a science?" In this paper I hope to take these questions head on.. I must begin by saying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I see it as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and man's interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest for understanding is the greatest challenge of the science.. I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on the scientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view is the scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment to the present.. I also intend to look critically at what I perceive to be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understand the phenomenon of information.. The criticism will by necessity be speculative.. I intend to stick my neck out, not because I can prove my assertions, but because I believe these ideas must be discussed.. .X 20	1	640 42	1	640 60	2	640 85	1	640 126	1	640 129	1	640 172	2	640 191	1	640 194	1	640 212	1	640 274	1	640 417	1	640 446	1	640 449	1	640 458	1	640 469	1	640 485	1	640 525	1	640 526	1	640 533	1	640 572	1	640 574	2	640 577	1	640 579	1	640 585	1	640 599	1	640 615	1	640 616	1	640 640	5	640 652	1	640 665	1	640 762	1	640 803	1	640 823	1	640 902	1	640 1022	1	640 1033	1	640 1045	1	640 1084	1	640 1268	1	640 1279	1	640 1305	1	640 1306	1	640 1313	1	640 1387	1	640 1387	1	640
