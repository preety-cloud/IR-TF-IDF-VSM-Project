Representation of Concept Relations Using the TOSAR System of the IDC: Treatise III on Information Retrieval Theory .A Fugmann, Robert Nickelsen, Herbert Nickelsen, Ingeborg Winter, Jakob H. Successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavily dependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in the particular language of the system and on the predictability of this representation.. If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed and the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity of the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptual distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The various index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences in their performance are correspondingly great.. The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and retrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a graph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these points represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry, these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language text..    .X 116	1	641 117	2	641 165	3	641 252	1	641 254	2	641 327	1	641 347	1	641 422	1	641 451	1	641 460	1	641 525	1	641 526	1	641 530	1	641 546	1	641 569	1	641 577	1	641 606	1	641 609	1	641 612	1	641 621	2	641 637	1	641 641	7	641 642	1	641 643	1	641 644	1	641 645	1	641 649	1	641 650	1	641 668	1	641 670	1	641 671	3	641 673	2	641 677	1	641 678	1	641 679	1	641 682	1	641 683	1	641 687	1	641 689	2	641 690	1	641 693	1	641 694	1	641 695	1	641 698	1	641 700	1	641 704	1	641 706	1	641 707	1	641 709	1	641 714	1	641 730	1	641 733	1	641 738	1	641 755	1	641 825	1	641 830	1	641 833	1	641 898	1	641 1026	1	641 1072	1	641 1077	1	641 1231	2	641 1292	1	641 1377	1	641 1452	2	641 1452	2	641
