A Probabilistic Approach to Automatic Keyword Indexing Part I. On the Distribution of Specialty Words in a Technical Literature .A Harter, Stephen P. The problem studied in this research is that of developing a set of formal statistical rules for the purpose of identifying the keywords of a document--words likely to be useful as index terms for that document.. The research was prompted by the observation, made by a number of writers, that non-specialty words, words which possess little value for indexing purposes, tend to be distributed at random in a collection of documents.. In contrast, specialty words are not so distributed.. In Part I of the study, a mixture of two Poisson distributions is examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution, and formulas expressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empirical frequency statistics are derived.. The fit of the model is tested on an experimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the purposes of the study.. A measure intended to identify specialty words, consistent with the 2-Poisson model, is proposed and evaluated.. .X 57	1	649 73	2	649 75	1	649 79	1	649 125	1	649 127	1	649 129	1	649 175	1	649 274	1	649 315	1	649 363	1	649 390	1	649 419	1	649 422	1	649 432	1	649 441	1	649 445	1	649 449	1	649 460	1	649 461	1	649 519	1	649 531	1	649 575	1	649 577	3	649 580	1	649 622	1	649 625	1	649 634	1	649 641	1	649 642	1	649 643	3	649 644	4	649 645	2	649 646	1	649 649	5	649 650	2	649 652	1	649 660	2	649 708	1	649 709	1	649 736	1	649 737	1	649 738	1	649 739	1	649 741	1	649 752	2	649 754	1	649 755	1	649 780	3	649 785	1	649 812	2	649 824	1	649 825	1	649 829	2	649 830	2	649 895	2	649 956	1	649 1282	2	649 1294	1	649 1307	1	649 1374	1	649 1376	1	649 1376	1	649
