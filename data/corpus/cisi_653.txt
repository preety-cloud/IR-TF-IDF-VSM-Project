Thesaurus Control - the Selection, Grouping, and Cross-Referencing of Terms for Inclusion in a Coordinate Index Word List .A Mandersloot, Wim G. B. Douglas, Eleanor M. B. Spicer, Neville The selection, grouping and cross-referencing of the (usually single-word) terms are based on: 1. A systematic approach to indexing in depth, based on earlier work and resulting in reasonably consistent indexing.. 2. An analytical approach to word forms in which the following categories are distinguished: ACTION forms; MEANS-material; MEANS-machine, and MEANS-man forms; STATES; VARIABLES; and LATENT PROPERTIES.. For each word, those forms included in a certain category are represented by a single code.. The category-switching caused by prepositions must be taken into account.. 3. Criteria for term-splitting with limited semantic factoring.. Occasionally, semantic integration is used.. 4. Critera for dealing with antonyms, which are classified as reciprocals, complements, unequivalent opposites, diametrical opposites, and reversals.. 5. Introduction of conditional cross-referencing.. 6.  Recognition of multiword synonyms as the major difficulty in coordinate indexing.. .X 82	1	653 149	1	653 151	1	653 159	1	653 160	1	653 175	1	653 257	1	653 429	1	653 454	1	653 476	1	653 477	4	653 489	1	653 493	1	653 498	1	653 501	2	653 504	1	653 558	1	653 582	1	653 583	1	653 600	2	653 653	9	653 655	1	653 688	1	653 746	1	653 781	2	653 796	1	653 797	1	653 798	1	653 801	1	653 802	2	653 838	2	653 898	1	653 901	1	653 1259	2	653 1265	1	653 1391	2	653 1394	1	653 1399	1	653 1405	1	653 1414	1	653 1422	1	653 1429	2	653 1430	2	653 1430	2	653
