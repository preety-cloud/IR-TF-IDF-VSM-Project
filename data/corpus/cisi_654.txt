An Analytical Model of a Library Network .A Nance, Richard E. Networks and network models of industrial and military systems have received much attention in operation research literature.. The extension of network modeling to library networks provides some interesting twists of the usual models.. A general library network is offered, a mathematical statement of the network problem is given, and the solution of the problem is discussed.. An example of the use of the model in evaluation and design situations is provided.. The necessity for further work in both theoretical and applied areas is cited in the summary.. .X 287	1	654 336	1	654 348	1	654 408	1	654 433	1	654 515	1	654 554	1	654 584	1	654 647	1	654 654	7	654 851	1	654 855	3	654 856	2	654 857	1	654 858	1	654 859	1	654 860	1	654 861	1	654 862	1	654 972	2	654 1011	1	654 1012	1	654 1013	1	654 1035	1	654 1184	1	654 1385	1	654 1445	1	654 1445	1	654
