The Potential Usefulness of Catalog Access Points Other Than Author, Title, and  Subject .A Cooper, William S. Library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which they have had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author- title-subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be able to look it up easily in present-day card catalogs.. However, they may remember a surprising amount of such "nonstandard" information as the color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this type of "nonstandard" information be profitably exploited in computerized catalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth as many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many situations.. .X 35	1	655 42	1	655 43	1	655 52	1	655 70	1	655 73	1	655 76	1	655 81	1	655 95	2	655 104	1	655 110	1	655 132	1	655 159	2	655 161	1	655 257	1	655 274	1	655 276	2	655 348	1	655 420	1	655 429	1	655 489	1	655 493	1	655 498	1	655 501	1	655 578	1	655 582	3	655 583	2	655 584	1	655 585	1	655 589	2	655 594	1	655 595	1	655 653	1	655 655	6	655 656	1	655 657	1	655 688	1	655 783	2	655 796	1	655 797	2	655 798	2	655 799	1	655 801	1	655 802	1	655 858	1	655 859	1	655 861	1	655 1054	1	655 1154	1	655 1232	1	655 1281	1	655 1287	1	655 1295	1	655 1297	1	655 1298	1	655 1300	1	655 1405	1	655 1445	1	655 1445	1	655
