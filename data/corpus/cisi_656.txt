Measures of the Usefulness of Written Technical Information to Chemical Researchers .A Kegan,  Daniel L. The effective transfer of technology involves more than just distributing paper; it demands that useful documents be disseminated with a minimum of useless ones.. For 1 month, 10 researchers recorded a sample of the written technical information items that they received; 4 months later they were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful, and in what ways.. The results indicate that (1) a researcher will call an item "useful" even if it does not cause him to take some action, but only has some significance for him; (2) the more the source of an item knows about the needs of the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks, the more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful; (3) no strong relationships were found between certain readily observable, physical arrangements and information behavior; and (4) an item may prove useful, not because of the information objectively contained in that item, but because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researcher's mind or a "free association." Other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness to externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness may not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher.. .X 29	1	656 35	1	656 42	1	656 43	1	656 52	1	656 58	1	656 70	1	656 73	1	656 81	1	656 89	1	656 95	1	656 105	1	656 109	1	656 110	1	656 155	1	656 157	2	656 165	1	656 314	1	656 356	1	656 420	1	656 426	1	656 445	1	656 451	1	656 475	1	656 544	1	656 560	1	656 578	1	656 582	2	656 589	1	656 590	1	656 594	1	656 595	1	656 609	1	656 655	1	656 656	5	656 657	1	656 658	1	656 685	1	656 689	1	656 762	1	656 814	1	656 901	1	656 1030	1	656 1050	1	656 1054	1	656 1062	1	656 1077	1	656 1154	1	656 1231	1	656 1232	1	656 1256	1	656 1281	1	656 1284	1	656 1285	1	656 1290	1	656 1291	1	656 1293	1	656 1294	1	656 1295	2	656 1296	1	656 1297	1	656 1298	1	656 1319	1	656 1321	1	656 1346	1	656 1361	1	656 1386	1	656 1386	1	656
