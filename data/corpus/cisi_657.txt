Standards For Writing Abstracts .A Weil, Ben H. An abstract, as defined here, is an abbreviated, accurate representation of a document.. The following recommendations are made for the guidance of authors and editors, so that abstracts in primary documents may be both helpful to their readers and reproducible with little or no change in secondary publications and services.. Prepare an abstract for every formal item in journals and proceedings, and for each separately published report, pamphlet, thesis, monograph, and patent.. Place the abstract as early as possible in the document.. Make the abstract as informative as the document will permit, so that readers may decide whether they need to read the entire document.. State the purpose, methods results, and conclusions presented in the document, either in that order or with initial emphasis on findings.. Make each abstract self-contained but concise; retain the basic information and tone of the original document..  Keep abstracts of most papers to fewer than 250 words, abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words (preferably on one page), and abstracts of short communications to fewer than 100 words.. Write most abstracts in a single paragraph.. Normally employ complete, connected sentences; active verbs; ad the third person.. Employ standard nomenclature, or define unfamiliar terms, abbreviations, and symbols the first time they occur in the abstract.. .X 35	2	657 42	1	657 43	1	657 52	1	657 70	1	657 73	1	657 81	1	657 91	1	657 95	1	657 166	1	657 175	2	657 324	1	657 420	2	657 429	1	657 491	1	657 496	1	657 499	1	657 503	2	657 513	1	657 517	1	657 571	2	657 576	2	657 578	1	657 582	3	657 588	1	657 589	4	657 594	1	657 595	1	657 603	1	657 613	1	657 614	1	657 618	1	657 655	1	657 656	1	657 657	10	657 666	1	657 685	1	657 686	1	657 690	1	657 691	1	657 712	2	657 721	1	657 722	1	657 724	1	657 725	1	657 958	1	657 987	1	657 988	1	657 1012	1	657 1054	2	657 1144	1	657 1154	1	657 1208	1	657 1232	1	657 1281	1	657 1293	2	657 1295	2	657 1296	1	657 1298	1	657 1302	1	657 1302	1	657
