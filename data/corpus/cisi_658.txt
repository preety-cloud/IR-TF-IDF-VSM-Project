Criteria Used by Research and Development Engineers in the Selection of an Information Source .A Gerstberger, Peter G. .A Allen, Thomas J. The criteria employed by engineers in the selection of various technical information channels in problem-solving endeavors are investigated.. The relationships of certain criteria identified in past research to such factors as frequency of channel utilization and the rate at which engineers accept or reject technical information received from specific channels are the focal points of the study.. A direct relationship is founded between perceived accessibility of information channels and several objective measures of utilization, whereas no definite support is found for the hypothesis that the channel perceived highest in technical quality are those used most frequently.. .X 15	1	658 24	1	658 62	1	658 65	1	658 66	1	658 75	1	658 76	1	658 96	2	658 137	1	658 152	1	658 157	1	658 210	1	658 278	1	658 279	1	658 280	1	658 356	1	658 371	1	658 382	1	658 386	1	658 391	2	658 395	1	658 398	1	658 426	1	658 436	2	658 437	2	658 475	3	658 656	1	658 658	9	658 716	1	658 748	1	658 760	1	658 770	1	658 771	2	658 776	1	658 782	1	658 788	2	658 789	1	658 837	1	658 925	1	658 967	1	658 1036	1	658 1050	2	658 1083	1	658 1154	1	658 1254	1	658 1285	1	658 1288	2	658 1321	1	658 1361	2	658 1400	1	658 1404	2	658 1408	1	658 1408	1	658
