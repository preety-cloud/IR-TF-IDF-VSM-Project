Is Automatic Classification a Reasonable Application of Statistical Analysis of Text? .A Doyle, Lauren B. The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and retrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machine searching and automatic classification.. The former approach has been favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for new methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those of traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been thriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed.. The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support the hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100 keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the range of one through eight words per document.. Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practical problems to be faced are outlined.. .X 26	1	661 28	1	661 30	1	661 42	1	661 43	1	661 45	1	661 72	1	661 79	1	661 174	2	661 176	1	661 309	1	661 310	1	661 328	2	661 363	1	661 389	1	661 390	1	661 419	2	661 422	1	661 434	1	661 454	1	661 479	2	661 483	2	661 485	2	661 562	1	661 564	3	661 565	3	661 660	2	661 661	6	661 662	2	661 663	3	661 664	1	661 714	1	661 769	2	661 1144	1	661 1327	2	661 1414	1	661 1419	1	661 1448	1	661 1448	1	661
