Automatic Document Classification   Part II. Additional Experiments .A Borko, Harold .A Bernick, Myrna This study reports the results of a series of experiments in the techniques of automatic document classification.. Two different classification schedules are compared along with two methods of automatically classifying documents into categories.. It is concluded that, while there is no significant difference in the predictive efficiency between the Bayesian and the factor score methods, automatic document classification is enhanced by the use of a factor-analytically-derived classification schedule.. Approximately 55 percent of the documents were automatically and correctly classified.. .X 26	2	663 28	1	663 42	1	663 45	3	663 72	1	663 79	1	663 174	2	663 310	1	663 315	1	663 419	2	663 420	1	663 421	1	663 422	1	663 454	1	663 479	2	663 483	1	663 485	2	663 562	2	663 564	4	663 565	1	663 660	1	663 661	3	663 662	4	663 663	5	663 664	2	663 714	1	663 769	2	663 1144	1	663 1279	1	663 1327	1	663 1419	1	663 1419	1	663
