Semantic Road Maps for Literature Searchers .A Doyle, Lauren B. The retrieval of documented information is one of today's most widespread technical problems, affecting almost every large professional group, corporation, and government bureau.. Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for.. .X 13	1	664 26	4	664 35	1	664 45	1	664 51	1	664 61	1	664 66	1	664 114	1	664 117	1	664 144	1	664 152	1	664 174	1	664 175	2	664 176	1	664 179	1	664 315	2	664 320	1	664 363	1	664 419	3	664 420	2	664 421	1	664 458	1	664 475	1	664 479	1	664 485	1	664 499	1	664 562	3	664 564	2	664 566	1	664 571	1	664 572	1	664 577	1	664 590	1	664 644	1	664 659	1	664 660	2	664 661	1	664 662	3	664 663	2	664 664	8	664 666	1	664 769	1	664 783	1	664 837	1	664 839	1	664 907	1	664 968	1	664 1046	1	664 1118	1	664 1144	1	664 1279	1	664 1327	1	664 1381	1	664 1382	1	664 1443	1	664 1443	1	664
