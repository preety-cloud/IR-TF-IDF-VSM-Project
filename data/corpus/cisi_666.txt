New Methods in Automatic Extracting .A Edmundson, H.P. This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents for screening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having the greatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance of the document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence location). The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposed components dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentence selection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words, key words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, research methodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation. .X 26	1	666 30	1	666 35	1	666 39	1	666 71	1	666 75	1	666 77	1	666 78	1	666 79	1	666 80	1	666 81	1	666 82	1	666 83	1	666 114	1	666 154	1	666 175	2	666 212	1	666 247	1	666 315	2	666 324	1	666 420	4	666 458	1	666 499	3	666 503	1	666 516	1	666 527	1	666 571	2	666 572	1	666 581	2	666 657	1	666 662	1	666 664	1	666 666	6	666 838	1	666 853	1	666 1393	1	666 1428	1	666 1431	1	666 1431	1	666
