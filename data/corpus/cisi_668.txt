The Automatic Encoding of Chemical Structures .A Feldman, A. Holland, D.B. Jacobus, D.P. Many methods for the coding of chemical structures have been described in the literature.	Some methods code the compound only partially; typical of these are the methods using descriptor codes.  Other methods, among which the so-called ciphers are prominent, code compounds exhaustively.  All these methods require cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how to dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  A disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore, that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to generate and how to interpret a chemical code.	Codes are needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical structures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would relieve the chemist of considerable burden. .X 116	1	668 117	2	668 165	1	668 254	2	668 327	1	668 445	1	668 476	1	668 525	1	668 590	1	668 621	1	668 641	1	668 668	7	668 670	2	668 671	2	668 673	1	668 674	1	668 675	1	668 677	1	668 678	1	668 679	1	668 682	1	668 683	1	668 689	2	668 690	3	668 693	1	668 694	1	668 695	1	668 698	1	668 700	1	668 704	1	668 706	1	668 707	1	668 715	1	668 730	2	668 738	1	668 797	1	668 819	1	668 833	1	668 1026	1	668 1072	1	668 1077	1	668 1231	1	668 1292	1	668 1452	1	668 1452	1	668
