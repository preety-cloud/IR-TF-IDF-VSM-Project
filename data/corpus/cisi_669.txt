Rapid Structure Searches via Permuted Chemical Line-Notations .A Sorter, P.F. Granito, C.E. Gilmer, J.C. Gelberg, A. Metcalf, E.A. The Wiswesser chemical line-notation is an unique and unambiguous method of representing chemical structures by a linear series of letters, numbers, ampersands, and hyphens.  These symbols are meaningful to chemists familiar with the notation and can be processed by automatic data processing (ADP) equipment. The uniqueness of the line-notation permits the use of alphanumerically arranged lists of notations for dictionary-type searches.  This ordered arrangement permits the rapid location of a specific compound or a specific class of ring compounds other than benzenoid. .X 669	6	669 673	3	669 678	1	669 682	1	669 687	2	669 693	1	669 704	1	669 706	1	669 833	1	669 1026	1	669 1452	3	669 1452	3	669
