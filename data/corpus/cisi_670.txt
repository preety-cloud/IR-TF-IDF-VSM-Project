A Chemical Structure Storage and Search System Developed at Du Pont .A Gluck, D.J. As early as 1961, we in the engineering Department of Du Pont recognized the need for a better system for recording chemical structure information for storage and subsequent retrieval.  We believed that current methods and the then current development of notation systems would not completely serve our chemists' long range chemical identification needs. Accordingly, we studied and then developed a chemical structure storage and search system.  Huber gave a good review of the various approaches and applications.  To use his terminology, our system is topological coding. Our initial investigation led to singling out the following needs for such a system.  .X 116	1	670 117	2	670 165	1	670 254	1	670 327	1	670 445	1	670 476	1	670 525	1	670 590	1	670 621	1	670 641	1	670 643	1	670 644	1	670 668	2	670 670	8	670 671	6	670 673	1	670 674	1	670 677	1	670 678	1	670 679	1	670 682	1	670 683	1	670 689	2	670 690	1	670 693	2	670 694	1	670 695	1	670 698	1	670 699	1	670 700	2	670 704	1	670 706	1	670 707	1	670 708	3	670 709	1	670 715	1	670 730	1	670 737	1	670 738	1	670 797	1	670 819	1	670 833	1	670 1026	1	670 1044	1	670 1072	1	670 1077	1	670 1231	1	670 1292	1	670 1452	2	670 1452	2	670
