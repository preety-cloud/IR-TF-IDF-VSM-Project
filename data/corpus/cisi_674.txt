Installation and Operation of a Registry for Chemical Compounds .A Leiter, D.P. Morgan, H.L. Stobaugh, R.E. Since 1958 the Chemical Abstracts Service has been working toward establishing a computer-based system for handling chemical information.  Briefly, the concept of the CAS system consists of sets of special subject files in the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2) chemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4) applications.  With the importance of compounds in correlation studies, and the need to interrelate compounds and the huge collections of chemical and other data, a highly developed subsystem, called the Registry System, for handling compounds must be the first step in the actual operation of an over-all computer-based service. The Registry System will include files of compounds interconnected with files of associated data that permit identifying the compounds and retrieving them from the files.  .X 34	1	674 53	1	674 117	1	674 165	1	674 252	1	674 445	1	674 476	1	674 480	1	674 525	1	674 565	1	674 590	1	674 621	1	674 668	1	674 670	1	674 671	3	674 674	9	674 675	1	674 679	1	674 680	1	674 682	1	674 683	1	674 687	1	674 689	1	674 694	1	674 695	1	674 697	2	674 698	1	674 709	3	674 711	1	674 715	2	674 746	1	674 797	1	674 819	1	674 1077	1	674 1231	1	674 1261	1	674 1452	2	674 1452	2	674
