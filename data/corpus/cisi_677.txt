Procedures for Converting Systematic Names of Organic Compounds into Atom-Bond Connection Tables .A Vander Stouw, G.G. Naznitsky, I. Rush, J.e. Simultaneously with its development of a computer-based Chemical Compound Registry System, Chemical Abstracts Service is devising procedures for automatically converting systematic names of organic compounds into atom- bound connection tables which can be manipulated by computer.  A study of systematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionary of word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting names to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexes show that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature, but also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been written which are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and the preparation of computer programs is now under way.  .X 116	1	677 117	1	677 253	1	677 254	1	677 327	1	677 641	1	677 668	1	677 670	1	677 671	1	677 673	1	677 677	6	677 678	1	677 679	1	677 682	1	677 689	1	677 690	1	677 693	1	677 694	1	677 695	1	677 698	1	677 700	1	677 701	2	677 704	1	677 706	2	677 707	1	677 730	1	677 738	1	677 833	1	677 1026	1	677 1072	1	677 1292	1	677 1301	1	677 1444	1	677 1452	2	677 1452	2	677
