A Chemical Notation and Code for Computer Manipulation .A Lefkovitz, D. This paper describes and specifies the rules for generating a code to represent chemical formulas.  It may be used either as a notation or for internal manipulation by computer for registration, screening, and atom-by- atom search.  It is basically a connection table in a concise format which also contains abnormality information relating to specific atoms or relations between atoms.  The notation produced by these rules unambiguously defines a structure (as a connection table), but the notation is unique only to a given numbering (or citation order) of the atoms.  Hence, its uniqueness is dependent on the numbering uniqueness of the atoms in the structural formula. Techniques for the use of the code in registry and substructure search are also discussed.  .X 116	1	678 117	1	678 254	1	678 327	1	678 641	1	678 668	1	678 669	1	678 670	1	678 671	1	678 673	2	678 675	1	678 677	1	678 678	7	678 679	2	678 682	4	678 689	1	678 690	1	678 693	1	678 694	1	678 695	1	678 698	1	678 700	1	678 704	2	678 706	2	678 707	1	678 730	1	678 738	1	678 833	1	678 1026	2	678 1072	1	678 1292	1	678 1419	1	678 1452	2	678 1452	2	678
