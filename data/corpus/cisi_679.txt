Conversion of Wiswesser Notation to a Connectivity Matrix for Organic Compounds .A Matthews, F.W. Hyde, E. Thomson, L.H. Wiswesser, W.J. A computer program is described which generates a connectivity matrix using as input an unmodified Wiswesser notation.  This program records the topology of a molecule as a statement of the atoms and their connectivity.  One symbol is used to represent each atom and this symbol is descriptive of the atom and its bonds.  The network of a complex molecule is recorded as a series of interruptions in an assumed linear path.  The application of this matrix to information handling of chemical structures is described in a subsequent paper. .X 116	1	679 117	1	679 254	1	679 327	1	679 641	1	679 668	1	679 670	1	679 671	1	679 673	2	679 674	1	679 675	1	679 677	1	679 678	2	679 679	5	679 681	1	679 682	1	679 687	1	679 689	1	679 690	1	679 693	1	679 694	1	679 695	1	679 697	1	679 698	1	679 700	1	679 704	1	679 706	1	679 707	1	679 730	1	679 738	1	679 833	1	679 1026	2	679 1072	1	679 1292	1	679 1452	4	679 1452	4	679
