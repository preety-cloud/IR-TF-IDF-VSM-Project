SWIFT:  Computerized Storage and Retrieval of Technical Information .A Ackermann, H.J. Haglind, J.B. Lindwall, H.F. Maizell, R.E. A unique method of computerized storage and retrieval of technical information is applied in the SWIFT (Significant Word in Full Title) program.  SWIFT chooses potential keywords from the titles, compares the key words with an exclusion word glossary to remove insignificant words and an internal glossary to prevent duplication of terms.  The keywords may be either a full or fragmented term. An option is available to index also by author.  Indexes, containing full citations, are printed periodically and cumulatively.  The magnetic tape file is available for computer search through a sort and print program.  Responses to inquiries conducted through the computer program are listed in full citation format. .X 29	1	680 34	1	680 53	1	680 68	1	680 69	1	680 175	1	680 252	1	680 261	1	680 346	1	680 382	1	680 458	1	680 476	1	680 477	1	680 478	1	680 479	1	680 480	2	680 484	1	680 485	1	680 565	1	680 566	1	680 673	1	680 674	1	680 680	5	680 704	1	680 711	1	680 715	1	680 746	1	680 781	1	680 1118	1	680 1175	1	680 1175	1	680
