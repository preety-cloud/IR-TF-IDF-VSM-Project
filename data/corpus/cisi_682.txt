Substructure Search in the MCC System .A Lefkovitz, D. A monitor system based upon computer-produced printed indexes is described in this paper.  The system is intended to monitor a large scale experiment in file organization for a real-time, interactive chemical information system.  It is based upon a topological screen system that ensures the inclusion of every compound atom (including H) in at least one screen assignment, that appears to be responsive to a broad range of query types, and that is amenable to random- access techniques.  The Monitor system is also considered, in this paper, as an independent interim approach toward fulfilling, in an effective and economic manner, the functional requirements of a small- to medium-sized chemical information system.  Thus it could be used to encode and generate structure files, to assign search screens, and to provide manual substructure search capability via microfilm or hard copy printed indexes. .X 116	1	682 117	1	682 150	1	682 254	1	682 327	1	682 347	1	682 371	1	682 465	1	682 480	1	682 641	1	682 668	1	682 669	1	682 670	1	682 671	1	682 673	2	682 674	1	682 677	1	682 678	4	682 679	1	682 681	1	682 682	6	682 689	1	682 690	1	682 693	1	682 694	2	682 695	2	682 697	1	682 698	2	682 700	1	682 704	3	682 706	1	682 707	1	682 716	1	682 717	1	682 730	1	682 738	1	682 833	1	682 1026	1	682 1072	1	682 1292	1	682 1419	1	682 1452	3	682 1452	3	682
