New Developments in Primary Journal Publication .A Kuney, J.H. The form and function of the journal as a medium of communication between scientists, that is, one scientist talking to another, have not changed greatly these past 100 years.	But during that time, the journal has evolved to a highly effective medium for meeting the scientists' needs for publication, distribution, storage, and retrieval of scientific information.  Kessler describes the journal as the most "successful and ubiquitous carrier of scientific information in the entire history of science."  And the scientific paper, he adds, "is such a marvelous and commodating invention that we seem to take it for granted and forget that it has form and structure that fit its function." .X 91	1	686 408	1	686 429	1	686 513	2	686 582	1	686 588	1	686 589	1	686 603	1	686 613	1	686 614	1	686 618	1	686 657	1	686 685	3	686 686	5	686 691	3	686 721	2	686 722	1	686 724	1	686 725	4	686 765	1	686 770	1	686 776	1	686 850	1	686 958	1	686 980	1	686 987	1	686 988	1	686 1208	2	686 1209	1	686 1290	2	686 1293	1	686 1302	1	686 1302	1	686
