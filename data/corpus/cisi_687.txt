Index Chemicus Registry System:  Pragmatic Approach to Substructure Chemical Retrieval .A Garfield, E. Revesz, G.S. Granito, C.E. Dorr, H.A. Calderon, M.M. Warner, A. The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS), launched in 1968 with the support of a dozen industrial and governmental organizations, is now a current operational monthly service.  Subscribers receive magnetic tapes and printouts, in which the weekly issues of Index Chemicus (IC) have been encoded in Wiswesser Line Notations (WLN).  Over 13,000 compounds per month are provided in machine language.  The canonical WLN is also provided in alphabetized printouts. Encoding of over 400,000 new chemical compounds from IC has already been completed, including all those reported in 1967, 1968, and 1969.  Since the tapes also include title and other bibliographic information, this paper describes the use of supporting software provided for SDI search systems employing "word" and other searching terms, in addition to the WLN fragments. Use of the monthly and annual printouts are illustrated for those searches which do not require computer manipulation. .X 164	1	687 165	1	687 252	1	687 253	2	687 254	1	687 347	1	687 491	1	687 512	1	687 591	1	687 641	1	687 669	2	687 671	1	687 673	2	687 674	1	687 679	1	687 683	2	687 687	10	687 689	1	687 697	1	687 714	2	687 726	1	687 805	1	687 809	1	687 1026	1	687 1087	1	687 1089	1	687 1285	1	687 1287	1	687 1302	1	687 1362	1	687 1452	4	687 1452	4	687
