Experience with the Mechanized Chemical and Biological Information Retrieval System .A Jacobus, D.P. Davidson, D.E. Feldman, A.P. Schafer, J.A. New computer methods have been developed in associations with the drug development programs of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  Experiences with these systems are recounted.  Special input devices and computer programming have been developed for the input and retrieval of conventional chemical structural diagrams.  The costs, operation, and the advantages of this system are discussed.  Associated files of biological properties and inventory control information have been created, which are searchable.  The methods used in creating consolidated listings of selected chemical compounds and associated biological data are discussed.  .X 116	2	690 117	1	690 166	1	690 254	2	690 316	1	690 327	1	690 491	1	690 496	1	690 582	1	690 641	1	690 657	1	690 668	3	690 670	1	690 671	2	690 673	1	690 677	1	690 678	1	690 679	1	690 682	1	690 689	1	690 690	9	690 693	1	690 694	3	690 695	2	690 697	1	690 698	2	690 699	2	690 700	2	690 704	1	690 706	1	690 707	1	690 710	1	690 730	2	690 737	1	690 738	1	690 833	1	690 1012	1	690 1026	1	690 1072	1	690 1292	2	690 1293	1	690 1295	1	690 1296	1	690 1452	1	690 1452	1	690
