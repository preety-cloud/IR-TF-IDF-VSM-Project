A selected sample of 281 readers of the Journal of Organic Chemistry has been interviewed personally to obtain data on their reading patterns of the November 1968 issue.  Approximately 35% of the individual subscribers to JOC had read or looked through the journal within the first seven days of receipt.  The average reader claims to have read part or all of 14 articles out of the 81 available.  At least 75% of every one of the 81 articles was read, ranging from a low of 0.7% to a high of 10.2%.  Structures or equations rated high as a "noted" segment of an article.  In addition to data on amount of reading of the issue, respondents were asked about amount of time spent reading, other journals read, and journals subscribed to.  Correlations have been developed between subject interest as stated by respondent and his actual reading pattern.  .X 91	1	691 429	1	691 513	1	691 582	1	691 588	1	691 589	1	691 603	1	691 613	1	691 614	1	691 618	1	691 657	1	691 685	2	691 686	3	691 691	5	691 721	2	691 722	1	691 724	1	691 725	3	691 765	1	691 770	1	691 776	1	691 958	1	691 987	1	691 988	1	691 1208	2	691 1209	1	691 1290	1	691 1293	1	691 1302	1	691 1302	1	691
