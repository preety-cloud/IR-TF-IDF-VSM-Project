Computer Generation of Wiswesser Line Notation .A Farrell, C.D. Chauvenet, A.R. Koniver, D.A. Computer programs developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) produce uncontracted though otherwise canonical Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) for a fairly broad class of compounds.  An associated front end allows a chemist to communicate with the programs by drawing structures on a Rand Tablet.  The WLN generation programs accept connection table input, either from a previously existing file or generated from the Rand Tablet drawing.  The programs recognize situations which they cannot handle - the output is thus either correct WLN or a message by which the programs acknowledge their limitations.  In general, correct WLN will be produced for any compound containing not more than one nonbenzene ring.  Work is under way to extend this to polycyclic fused ring systems.  The philosophy and concepts behind these programs are explained along with the more interesting algorithmic results.  The role of the WLN-generation programs in a developing NIH chemical information system is briefly discussed. The WLN programs are written in Fortran IV and have been developed on a PDP-10 computer. .X 116	1	694 117	1	694 254	1	694 316	1	694 327	1	694 641	1	694 668	1	694 670	1	694 671	1	694 673	1	694 674	1	694 677	1	694 678	1	694 679	1	694 682	2	694 689	1	694 690	3	694 693	1	694 694	7	694 695	4	694 697	2	694 698	4	694 700	1	694 704	1	694 706	1	694 707	1	694 730	1	694 738	1	694 833	1	694 1026	1	694 1072	1	694 1292	2	694 1452	3	694 1452	3	694
