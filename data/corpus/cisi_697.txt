Computer Generation of Wiswesser Line Notation. II. Polyfused, Perifused, and Chained Ring Structure .A Heller, Stephen R. .A Koniver, Deena A. The computer program for the generation of Weswesser Line Notation (WLN) has been extended to include polyfused rings, methyl contraction rules, chain of two ring systems, some perifused rings, some chelates, and some metallocences.. Salts and ions are also handled, but in a different manner than what is normally found.. Multipliers are not used by the program.. The normal input for the WLN generation is an easy input program using a Rand Tablet; however, teletype and connection table input can also be used in most cases.. .X 75	1	697 316	1	697 568	1	697 674	2	697 679	1	697 682	1	697 687	1	697 690	1	697 694	2	697 695	2	697 697	5	697 698	2	697 700	1	697 726	1	697 1092	1	697 1452	3	697 1452	3	697
