A Graph-Theoretic Algorithm for Matching Chemical Structures .A Sussenguth, E.H., Jr. There are many chemical retrieval systems which process the first type of request efficiently.  Most of these systems are also capable of handling certain fragment requests; however, the fragments which can be processed are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are readily detected.  To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures. Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm, some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for a digital computer is discussed. This report is a condensed version of the original, which gives a generalization and comprehensive description of the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics, and applications other than chemical retrieval systems. .X 116	1	706 117	1	706 253	1	706 254	1	706 327	3	706 568	2	706 569	1	706 641	1	706 668	1	706 669	1	706 670	1	706 671	2	706 673	1	706 677	2	706 678	2	706 679	1	706 682	1	706 689	1	706 690	1	706 693	1	706 694	1	706 695	1	706 698	1	706 700	1	706 704	1	706 706	10	706 707	1	706 730	1	706 738	1	706 833	1	706 890	3	706 1026	2	706 1072	1	706 1092	1	706 1202	1	706 1292	2	706 1301	1	706 1444	1	706 1452	2	706 1452	2	706
