The Chemical Abstracts Service Chemical Registry System.  I. General Design .A Dittmar, P.G. Stobaugh, R.E. Watson, C.E. The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System is a computer- based system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis of composition and structure.  Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone input, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic chemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been integrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system, Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques for registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each substance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature derivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The general design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic segments, is presented. .X 422	1	709 577	1	709 641	1	709 643	1	709 644	1	709 645	1	709 649	1	709 650	1	709 670	1	709 671	2	709 674	3	709 675	1	709 700	1	709 701	1	709 708	1	709 709	8	709 731	1	709 738	2	709 755	1	709 825	1	709 830	1	709 1261	1	709 1292	1	709 1292	1	709
