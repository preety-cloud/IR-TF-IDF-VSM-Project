Technical-Abstracting Fundamentals. II. Writing Principles and Practices .A Weil, B.H. Zarember, I. Owen, H. Abstracts can serve their purpose best only if they are carefully written to transmit important information to readers quickly and accurately.  This requires knowledge of audience needs, habits, and desires; ability to identify the key facts in the document; ability to organize these facts, to present them in the order best suited to the audience; and ability to write the abstracts clearly, concisely, and in conformity with the style rules of the medium involved.  Some of these abilities are inborn, but all can be learned by study, practice, and criticism. .X 35	1	712 571	1	712 657	2	712 672	1	712 712	5	712 1054	1	712 1118	1	712 1124	1	712 1124	1	712
