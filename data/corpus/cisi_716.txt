Reading Behavior of Chemists .A Gushee, D.E. Most discussions about the future design of chemical information systems emphasize the effects of computer speed on composition, storage, searching, and retrieval.  Little attention has been paid to the behavior of the scientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literature in that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behavior and thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion that the literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  What seems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that the new and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and that the system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selective compression. .X 24	1	716 32	1	716 62	1	716 65	1	716 66	1	716 75	1	716 76	1	716 137	2	716 150	1	716 210	1	716 255	2	716 278	1	716 279	1	716 280	1	716 347	1	716 355	1	716 371	1	716 382	1	716 386	1	716 395	1	716 398	1	716 465	1	716 480	1	716 592	1	716 658	1	716 681	1	716 682	1	716 704	1	716 716	5	716 717	1	716 735	1	716 748	1	716 782	1	716 788	1	716 789	1	716 837	1	716 925	1	716 1037	1	716 1045	1	716 1083	1	716 1087	1	716 1089	1	716 1298	1	716 1361	1	716 1400	1	716 1404	1	716 1404	1	716
