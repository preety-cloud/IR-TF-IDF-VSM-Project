Critical Reviews: The User's Point of View .A Herring, C. Scientists are worried about the "information explosion" and the amount of published literature that could have a significant impact on their work. One thing that can help is a condensation and evaluation of the published material. This is the task of reviews, and without them, the other tools for dealing with the information explosion will be inadequate. Suggestions are made on ways for authors and editors to make their reviews more eccessible and more useful and on the need for better education of users. .X 59	1	719 63	1	719 175	1	719 347	1	719 355	2	719 481	1	719 482	1	719 717	1	719 718	4	719 719	5	719 958	2	719 980	1	719 1010	1	719 1042	1	719 1051	1	719 1094	1	719 1099	1	719 1102	1	719 1107	1	719 1179	1	719 1410	1	719 1415	1	719 1426	1	719 1426	1	719
