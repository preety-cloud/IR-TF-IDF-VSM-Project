A Selective Current-Awareness System Using Engineering Index's Plastics Data Base.  II. Performance .A Wagner, R.H. The operational performance over a 17-month period of the previously described selective dissemination system is presented.  Of the 21,000 notifications sent to about 20 users, 91% were evaluated; of these, 14% were of "Document-Ordered Interest," 48% were "Of Interest," 27% were "Marginal," and 11% were "Of No Interest."  Recall data obtained from about half the users over a period of eight months show the precision- factor/recall-factor products are generally greater than 0.5.  The effect of iterative profile adjustments on precision-recall performance is discussed.  A comparison made with four other SDI systems shows a relatively high level of performance for this system. .X 13	1	720 59	1	720 71	1	720 72	1	720 73	1	720 74	1	720 75	2	720 76	1	720 77	1	720 78	1	720 79	1	720 81	1	720 82	1	720 83	1	720 86	1	720 121	1	720 153	1	720 156	1	720 211	1	720 212	1	720 213	1	720 245	1	720 277	1	720 279	1	720 280	1	720 465	1	720 466	1	720 486	1	720 720	5	720 748	1	720 785	1	720 786	1	720 787	1	720 788	1	720 789	1	720 791	1	720 914	1	720 925	1	720 984	1	720 1362	1	720 1363	1	720 1363	1	720
