User Experiences with Primary Journals on 16-Mm Microfilm .A Starker, L.N. The availability of scientific journals on 16-mm film is a relatively new phenomenon.  User acceptance of this microfilm application has been greatly improved by loading the file into cartridges and making use of motor-driven reader-printers.  This equipment permits rapid searching of the microfilm and adds the convenience of on-the-spot hard-copy prints as needed.  Of prime importance are the economic advantages of these editions, since they allow many special libraries to stretch greatly the space available to them for journal housing.  The economics of this approach are also discussed, as are the reactions of the scientists and information personnel who use them. .X 91	1	721 286	2	721 429	1	721 513	1	721 582	1	721 588	1	721 589	1	721 603	1	721 613	1	721 614	1	721 618	1	721 657	1	721 672	2	721 685	2	721 686	2	721 691	2	721 721	5	721 722	1	721 724	2	721 725	2	721 765	1	721 770	1	721 776	1	721 958	1	721 987	1	721 988	1	721 1014	2	721 1058	1	721 1208	2	721 1209	1	721 1290	1	721 1293	1	721 1302	1	721 1352	1	721 1352	1	721
