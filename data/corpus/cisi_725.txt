An Inquiry on New Forms of Primary Publications .A Moore, J.A. Some of the problems associated with present journal publications practices are discussed.  These are attributed to the fact that as the literature has expanded, the needs of both authors and readers are no longer being met by printing and distributing all of the material accepted to all subscribers. A two-edition system is proposed, with short versions of papers in a broad circulation issue and expanded versions, including full details and discussion, in library-circulation microfilm editions.  Reactions of chemists to such a system are discussed.  It is recommended that two-edition journals be developed in a evolutionary way by increasing use of the ACS mcirofilm editions for sections of articles and for supplementary documents to accompany communications. .X 91	2	725 375	1	725 406	1	725 429	1	725 513	2	725 582	1	725 588	1	725 589	1	725 603	1	725 607	1	725 613	1	725 614	1	725 618	1	725 657	1	725 685	3	725 686	4	725 691	3	725 721	2	725 722	1	725 724	1	725 725	6	725 765	1	725 770	1	725 776	1	725 958	1	725 987	1	725 988	1	725 1057	1	725 1208	2	725 1209	1	725 1290	2	725 1293	1	725 1302	1	725 1364	1	725 1364	1	725
