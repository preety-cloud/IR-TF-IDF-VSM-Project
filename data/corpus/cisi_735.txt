Journals Most Cited by Chemists and Chemical Engineers .A Barrett, R.L. Barrett, M.A. The purpose of this paper is to present up-to-date material to indicate some of the changes that have taken place during and since World War II.  For purposes of comparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is represented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  The results of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4. The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  About half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers published in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects the present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation and its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another striking fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work published in the journal itself.  In Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations is 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the fact that writers who habitually publish in a particular journal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seems to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these journals in their respective fields.  More than 38% of the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry are to various American Chemical Society publications. In the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than 45% of the citations are to Society publications. .X 33	1	735 36	1	735 37	1	735 41	1	735 76	1	735 89	3	735 97	1	735 102	1	735 111	1	735 112	1	735 163	1	735 183	2	735 184	2	735 193	2	735 198	3	735 199	1	735 201	1	735 203	1	735 204	1	735 210	1	735 225	1	735 255	1	735 269	1	735 373	1	735 379	1	735 473	1	735 543	1	735 545	1	735 552	2	735 587	1	735 588	1	735 592	1	735 605	1	735 613	1	735 614	2	735 616	1	735 638	2	735 685	1	735 716	1	735 735	7	735 747	1	735 750	1	735 753	1	735 766	2	735 767	1	735 775	2	735 782	1	735 784	3	735 788	1	735 789	1	735 793	1	735 800	1	735 808	1	735 821	1	735 828	1	735 905	1	735 907	1	735 952	1	735 953	1	735 977	1	735 983	1	735 1016	1	735 1023	1	735 1030	1	735 1055	2	735 1087	2	735 1089	1	735 1090	1	735 1135	1	735 1209	1	735 1210	1	735 1260	2	735 1275	4	735 1276	2	735 1278	1	735 1280	1	735 1283	1	735 1285	2	735 1286	1	735 1287	1	735 1290	1	735 1298	1	735 1302	3	735 1335	1	735 1355	1	735 1390	1	735 1397	2	735 1417	1	735 1428	1	735 1432	2	735 1432	2	735
