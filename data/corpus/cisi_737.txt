The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma .A Lefkovitz, D. This paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random file organization methods for handling two major applications - Transaction oriented systems and Information storage and retrieval systems.  It then addresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorily resolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under active investigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One is called the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique called super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics related to file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational cost and performance statistics are not yet available. .X 62	1	737 125	1	737 127	2	737 129	1	737 310	1	737 318	1	737 363	2	737 409	1	737 432	1	737 460	1	737 461	1	737 462	1	737 580	1	737 604	1	737 622	1	737 642	1	737 643	2	737 644	2	737 645	1	737 646	1	737 649	1	737 650	1	737 670	1	737 690	1	737 699	2	737 700	2	737 708	2	737 736	1	737 737	5	737 738	1	737 739	1	737 741	1	737 853	1	737 875	1	737 883	1	737 1044	1	737 1274	1	737 1374	1	737 1376	1	737 1419	1	737 1419	1	737
