Managerial Cost Accounting for a Technical Information Center .A Helmkamp, John G. The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a technical center to test the hypothesis that: A theoretically-sound managerial cost-accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by other enterprises.. A computerized cost system was developed and operated for a three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical information center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to measure the operating performance of the center's production process.. A summary of the data that were reported regularly to management is presented in this paper.. .X 24	1	74 27	1	74 71	1	74 72	1	74 73	1	74 74	8	74 75	2	74 77	1	74 78	1	74 79	1	74 81	1	74 82	1	74 83	5	74 86	1	74 119	1	74 122	1	74 153	1	74 156	1	74 158	1	74 211	1	74 212	1	74 245	2	74 273	1	74 277	1	74 279	3	74 280	1	74 288	1	74 331	1	74 336	1	74 381	1	74 408	1	74 486	1	74 490	2	74 491	1	74 492	1	74 495	1	74 496	2	74 497	1	74 584	3	74 591	3	74 592	1	74 606	1	74 684	1	74 720	1	74 723	1	74 724	1	74 748	1	74 785	1	74 786	1	74 787	1	74 788	1	74 789	1	74 791	1	74 834	1	74 841	1	74 860	1	74 925	2	74 955	1	74 957	1	74 976	1	74 984	1	74 1011	1	74 1148	1	74 1227	1	74 1317	1	74 1353	1	74 1359	2	74 1360	2	74 1400	1	74 1410	1	74 1424	1	74 1451	1	74 1451	1	74
