Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics? .A Pritchard, A. The term statistical bibliography seems to have been first used by E. Wyndham Hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the Sandars Reader in bibliography at the University of Cambridge.  Subsequently the lectures were published as a book.  Although the debt has never been explicitly recognized by means of citations, Hulme anticipated modern work on the history of science.  He used the term to mean the illumination of the processes of science and technology by means of counting documents.  Hulme both summarized the results of Cole and Eales and produced original work on the growth of UK patents (relating these to social progress in the UK) and on the changes displayed in the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature (relating changes in subject and country production of literature to international developments). .X 19	1	749 37	1	749 39	2	749 40	1	749 47	1	749 88	1	749 97	1	749 102	1	749 103	1	749 162	2	749 233	1	749 253	1	749 313	1	749 359	1	749 377	1	749 379	2	749 395	1	749 505	1	749 560	1	749 573	1	749 583	1	749 618	1	749 632	2	749 635	1	749 667	1	749 748	1	749 749	6	749 751	1	749 764	1	749 765	2	749 770	1	749 777	1	749 778	1	749 782	1	749 804	1	749 805	1	749 893	2	749 914	1	749 952	1	749 1016	1	749 1061	1	749 1076	1	749 1085	1	749 1086	1	749 1087	1	749 1182	1	749 1200	1	749 1274	1	749 1277	1	749 1278	1	749 1280	1	749 1287	1	749 1301	1	749 1302	1	749 1304	1	749 1313	1	749 1338	1	749 1344	1	749 1347	1	749 1380	2	749 1428	2	749 1444	1	749 1444	1	749
