On the Inverse Relationship of Recall and Precision .A Cleverdon, C.W. It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presented which appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverse relationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly not new; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and ABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not- Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising from Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked. In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, has four qualifications to the basic statement. .X 28	1	752 57	1	752 73	3	752 75	1	752 79	1	752 134	1	752 146	1	752 157	1	752 175	2	752 194	1	752 224	1	752 274	1	752 298	1	752 315	1	752 381	2	752 382	1	752 389	3	752 390	4	752 419	1	752 441	1	752 445	1	752 447	1	752 449	1	752 456	1	752 458	2	752 468	1	752 509	1	752 514	3	752 518	1	752 531	1	752 554	1	752 575	2	752 577	2	752 579	1	752 591	1	752 595	2	752 599	1	752 603	1	752 615	2	752 619	1	752 620	1	752 621	1	752 625	3	752 630	1	752 634	1	752 639	1	752 643	1	752 644	2	752 646	1	752 649	2	752 652	1	752 660	2	752 752	11	752 754	1	752 780	5	752 785	4	752 795	1	752 806	1	752 812	3	752 820	1	752 822	2	752 824	1	752 827	1	752 829	2	752 830	1	752 895	2	752 907	1	752 956	1	752 1044	1	752 1091	1	752 1255	2	752 1282	4	752 1294	1	752 1307	1	752 1327	1	752 1327	1	752
