Optimization of Library Expenditure on Biochemical Journals .A Line, M.B. In a 1973 paper, Sengupta analysed references to biochemical journals in an attempt to provide a guide for librarians with a limited budget.  He not only ranked journals by the absolute number of citations made to 1969 volumes, but related the number of citations to the number of papers and even to the number of words in each journal, as perhaps 'a better guide to selection of journals for subscription than position in the ranking list.'  (A similar procedure is adopted in two more recent articles by Sengupta on physiology and microbiology journals.) .X 48	1	756 167	2	756 359	1	756 614	1	756 625	1	756 634	1	756 635	1	756 638	2	756 748	2	756 753	2	756 756	5	756 757	2	756 764	1	756 787	1	756 792	1	756 808	1	756 821	1	756 831	1	756 952	1	756 953	1	756 1083	1	756 1210	1	756 1254	1	756 1256	1	756 1260	1	756 1275	1	756 1278	1	756 1302	2	756 1369	1	756 1373	1	756 1418	1	756 1418	1	756
