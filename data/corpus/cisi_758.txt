A Scientific Theory of Classification and Indexing and Its Practical Application .A Farradane, J. E. L. A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification.. Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates, and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form.. The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with complete flexibility.. .X 160	1	758 258	1	758 259	1	758 476	1	758 477	1	758 478	2	758 480	2	758 516	2	758 542	1	758 758	5	758 785	1	758 1215	1	758 1231	1	758 1259	1	758 1391	2	758 1405	1	758 1405	1	758
