A New Look at Reference Scattering .A Cole, P.F. It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journal references on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a small proportion of the total titles.  Bradford listed the journals concerned in order of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced, he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many later workers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of literature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these results Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference scattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted not a straight line but a curve.  Kendall has now provided a more refined statistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford. .X 33	1	759 36	1	759 44	1	759 46	1	759 57	2	759 76	1	759 81	1	759 184	1	759 193	1	759 195	1	759 201	1	759 203	1	759 204	1	759 205	1	759 233	1	759 267	1	759 359	5	759 361	3	759 367	1	759 395	1	759 416	2	759 505	1	759 515	1	759 573	1	759 587	1	759 616	1	759 667	1	759 748	3	759 750	1	759 751	2	759 759	12	759 760	1	759 765	7	759 767	2	759 775	2	759 776	3	759 778	4	759 787	2	759 791	1	759 792	1	759 793	1	759 800	1	759 893	1	759 977	1	759 983	1	759 1016	1	759 1030	1	759 1076	1	759 1081	2	759 1082	2	759 1083	3	759 1085	2	759 1086	1	759 1090	1	759 1097	1	759 1098	1	759 1114	1	759 1122	1	759 1157	1	759 1170	2	759 1173	1	759 1182	4	759 1201	2	759 1226	1	759 1275	1	759 1278	1	759 1381	1	759 1401	1	759 1417	1	759 1418	1	759 1432	1	759 1432	1	759
