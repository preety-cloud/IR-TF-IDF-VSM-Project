The Foreign-Language Problem Facing Scientists and Technologists in the United Kingdom - Report of a Recent Survey .A Wood, D. N. The foreign-language barrier facing British scientists is a function of a, the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced; b, the linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it; and c, the availability and effectiveness of translation services.. To obtain quantitative data on these points the NLL has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and librarians in the United Kingdom and the present paper presents the more important results.. The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languages creating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and that, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their difficulties.. The results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which the appropriate authorities might follow..  The most important would seem to be the publishing of a international index to translations and the creation within the United Kingdom of a centralized Japanese translation service.. .X 2	1	760 31	1	760 34	1	760 36	1	760 37	1	760 41	1	760 46	1	760 53	1	760 76	1	760 132	1	760 137	2	760 139	1	760 152	1	760 155	1	760 161	1	760 166	1	760 181	1	760 182	1	760 183	2	760 184	1	760 193	1	760 195	2	760 198	1	760 201	1	760 203	1	760 204	1	760 210	1	760 269	1	760 371	1	760 382	1	760 395	1	760 415	1	760 456	1	760 475	2	760 552	1	760 658	1	760 711	1	760 759	1	760 760	16	760 767	1	760 770	1	760 772	1	760 774	2	760 775	2	760 776	2	760 777	1	760 778	1	760 788	2	760 789	2	760 889	1	760 891	1	760 900	4	760 905	1	760 952	1	760 953	1	760 964	1	760 967	1	760 968	1	760 977	1	760 1009	1	760 1018	1	760 1019	1	760 1055	1	760 1056	1	760 1118	1	760 1240	1	760 1254	1	760 1281	1	760 1359	1	760 1397	1	760 1404	1	760 1417	1	760 1451	1	760 1451	1	760
