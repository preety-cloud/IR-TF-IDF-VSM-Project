Minimum Vocabularies in Information Indexing .A Moss, R. Words have no precision, though in information storage and retrieval we are required to act as if they did.. We have, therefore, to impose certain arbitrary conditions to reduce the element of personal interpretation.. 'Meaning' must be remove from the indexing stage to that of vocabulary construction.. Vocabularies can be reduced to a minimum, first to a core of terms used in specialist science, and, following Russel, ultimately to undefined terms symbolic of sense experience.. 'Basic English' has shown similar minimizing to be feasible for a natural language.. The success of Batten cards shown that the principle could be equally applicable to specialist indexing vocabularies.. .X 42	1	761 119	1	761 149	1	761 152	1	761 258	1	761 388	1	761 458	1	761 558	1	761 714	1	761 761	5	761 907	1	761 1175	1	761 1309	1	761 1381	1	761 1394	1	761 1407	1	761 1407	1	761
