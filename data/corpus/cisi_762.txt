Opening the Black Box of 'Relevance' .A Cuarda, Carlos A. .A Katter, Robert V. The purpose of this project was to identify variables thought to affect relevance judgements and conduct a series of laboratory studies to determine the effects of these variables on relevance judgements.. This paper discusses the variable of 'implicit use orientations' - the particular attitude taken by a subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and forty judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another.. Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgements have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarily obtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation studies.. .X 3	1	762 20	1	762 29	2	762 35	1	762 42	3	762 43	1	762 58	2	762 60	1	762 70	1	762 72	1	762 75	1	762 84	1	762 85	1	762 129	1	762 149	1	762 165	1	762 172	1	762 382	1	762 444	2	762 445	2	762 447	1	762 449	1	762 451	1	762 469	1	762 474	1	762 486	1	762 532	1	762 554	1	762 565	1	762 585	1	762 590	1	762 595	1	762 599	1	762 608	1	762 609	1	762 625	1	762 640	1	762 652	2	762 656	1	762 660	2	762 665	1	762 689	1	762 762	7	762 764	1	762 803	1	762 814	1	762 893	1	762 901	1	762 956	1	762 961	1	762 1016	1	762 1022	1	762 1030	1	762 1045	2	762 1077	1	762 1084	1	762 1195	1	762 1201	1	762 1231	1	762 1235	1	762 1268	1	762 1281	2	762 1285	1	762 1294	1	762 1294	1	762
