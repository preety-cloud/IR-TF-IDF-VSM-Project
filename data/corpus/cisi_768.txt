Student Attitudes to the University Library.  A Survey at Southampton University .A Line, M.B. A good deal is now known about the use made by students of university libraries, notably from the surveys carried out by Leeds University Library in 1957 and 1960.  Statistics of use, however, will not by themselves indicate how good a library is, whether as a bookstock, a building, or an administrative department.  How adequate is the bookstock?  How fully is it being exploited?  How important are physical and personal elements? These are questions librarians are continually asking themselves, but they are also questions readers could be asked directly or indirectly. .X 4	2	768 9	1	768 32	1	768 96	1	768 137	1	768 163	1	768 207	1	768 278	1	768 293	1	768 298	1	768 300	1	768 370	1	768 418	1	768 456	1	768 648	1	768 768	8	768 774	4	768 783	2	768 799	1	768 811	1	768 816	1	768 818	2	768 823	1	768 839	1	768 842	1	768 843	1	768 844	1	768 847	1	768 872	1	768 913	2	768 961	1	768 962	1	768 964	1	768 968	1	768 970	1	768 1068	1	768 1069	1	768 1070	1	768 1203	1	768 1214	1	768 1246	1	768 1263	2	768 1321	1	768 1401	1	768 1407	1	768 1434	1	768 1445	1	768 1445	1	768
