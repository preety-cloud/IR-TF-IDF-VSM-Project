Keywords and Clumps .A Needham, R.M. Jones, K.S. Recent work at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been concerned with the development of automatic classification procedures for information retrieval.  This has taken the form of research into methods of classification of keywords extracted from documents, with a view to using the classes found for co-ordinate indexing of technical material.  We cannot claim to have solved this problem because the methods we have been able to develop so far cannot be applied on a sufficiently large scale.  We have, however, made enough progress to make us feel that this a fruitful line of research. .X 26	1	769 45	1	769 50	1	769 131	1	769 174	2	769 175	1	769 310	1	769 328	1	769 382	1	769 389	2	769 419	1	769 422	1	769 454	1	769 479	2	769 483	1	769 485	2	769 562	1	769 564	2	769 565	1	769 660	1	769 661	2	769 662	2	769 663	2	769 664	1	769 769	7	769 780	1	769 785	1	769 966	1	769 1118	1	769 1144	1	769 1255	1	769 1327	1	769 1419	1	769 1419	1	769
