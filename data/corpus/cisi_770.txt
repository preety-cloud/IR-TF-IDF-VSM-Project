Tests on Abstracts Journals .A Martyn, J. Slater, M. The amount of scientific and technical information published annually in the form of journal articles, conference papers, reports, theses, patents, and books now greatly exceeds, in every field of interest, the amount which may be scanned by a scientist wishing to keep himself completely up to date in his own subject.  For a scientist wishing to inform himself of new developments in neighbouring subject-fields the problem is even greater.  Consequently, either the scientist reconciles himself to the knowledge that he is not aware of all relevant information in his field or he places increasingly more reliance on such bibliographic tools as are available to guide him towards the relevant literature. First among such tools is the abstracts journal. .X 2	1	770 4	1	770 65	1	770 114	1	770 154	1	770 158	1	770 162	2	770 194	1	770 212	1	770 371	1	770 382	1	770 458	2	770 475	1	770 513	1	770 580	1	770 582	1	770 613	1	770 622	2	770 627	1	770 658	1	770 685	1	770 686	1	770 691	1	770 696	1	770 705	1	770 721	1	770 722	1	770 725	1	770 728	1	770 729	1	770 749	1	770 760	1	770 765	1	770 770	12	770 776	8	770 796	1	770 802	1	770 815	1	770 914	1	770 967	1	770 981	1	770 1030	1	770 1076	2	770 1097	1	770 1098	1	770 1157	1	770 1176	1	770 1208	1	770 1209	1	770 1290	1	770 1392	1	770 1404	1	770 1414	1	770 1431	1	770 1448	1	770 1448	1	770
