Survey of Information Needs of Physicists and Chemists .A Aims, A. Scientific research is expensive and the practical application of its results is even more expensive.  Information services are relatively inexpensive and, by constantly improving their scope and efficiency and encouraging the scientist to make the best use of them, we can minimize duplication and inefficiency in research and development.  This is the justification for the present survey and for all the work on user needs which has preceded it. .X 2	1	771 32	1	771 96	1	771 132	1	771 161	1	771 475	1	771 658	2	771 771	5	771 788	1	771 965	1	771 1095	1	771 1099	1	771 1102	1	771 1111	1	771 1151	1	771 1154	1	771 1158	1	771 1254	1	771 1321	1	771 1330	1	771 1361	1	771 1408	1	771 1446	1	771 1447	1	771 1447	1	771
