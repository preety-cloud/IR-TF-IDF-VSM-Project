Information Use Studies Part 2 - Comparison of Some Recent Surveys .A Barnes, R.C.M. Information-use studies are vitally necessary in order to complement, challenge, and sharpen informed intuitive judgements, but even the broadest conclusions drawn from such studies need to be examined critically. The conclusions or their generality may sometimes be invalidated by special conditions in the survey sample, by the environment having been disturbed by the survey, by the interpretation given to questions or observations, or by the way the data has been analyzed.	These same factors make direct comparison of results from different surveys difficult, and make superficial comparisons misleading.  Some comparisons and conclusions are certainly much less sound than the casual reader might suppose, particularly when results have been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey. The difficulty of comparing information-use surveys is well illustrated by the copious footnotes used by Menzel, Lieberman, and Dulchin in order to qualify the significance of the results which they compare. .X 14	1	772 41	1	772 132	2	772 137	2	772 147	1	772 161	2	772 237	1	772 272	1	772 456	1	772 624	1	772 760	1	772 763	1	772 767	1	772 772	6	772 900	1	772 952	1	772 965	1	772 1030	1	772 1095	1	772 1155	1	772 1156	1	772 1158	1	772 1160	1	772 1254	1	772 1275	1	772 1280	1	772 1353	1	772 1361	1	772 1361	1	772
