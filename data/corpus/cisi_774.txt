Student Attitudes to the University Library: A Second Survey at Southampton University .A Line, Maurice B. .A Tidmarsh, Mavis In May 1965 a survey into student attitudes to the Library of Southampton University was carried out by questionnaire with a sample of 322 undergraduates.. The aim was to assess the effect, if any, of the considerable measures taken since the 1962 survey.. Uncontrolled factors, mainly related to the rapid expansion of the University, may. however, have effected the results.. It appears that, except for social science students, there were few improvements in attitudes and use, and that seminars had little measurable effect.. Possible explanations for this are offered, and the place of reader services in a university library discussed.. Other items covered by the survey include the use of libraries in Halls of resinence and of Southampton Public Libraries, which in both cases showed a sharp decline since 1962, the number and cost of books bought by undergraduates, and their use of libraries in vacations.. .X 2	1	774 4	2	774 9	1	774 31	1	774 32	1	774 36	1	774 41	1	774 46	1	774 76	1	774 96	1	774 132	1	774 137	2	774 139	1	774 152	1	774 155	1	774 163	1	774 181	1	774 182	1	774 183	2	774 184	1	774 193	1	774 195	2	774 198	1	774 201	1	774 203	1	774 204	1	774 207	1	774 210	1	774 269	1	774 293	1	774 298	1	774 370	1	774 395	1	774 415	1	774 418	1	774 456	1	774 475	1	774 552	1	774 648	1	774 760	2	774 767	1	774 768	4	774 774	6	774 775	1	774 778	1	774 783	1	774 788	1	774 789	1	774 799	1	774 811	1	774 816	1	774 818	1	774 823	1	774 839	1	774 842	1	774 843	1	774 844	1	774 847	1	774 891	1	774 905	1	774 913	1	774 952	1	774 953	1	774 961	1	774 962	1	774 964	2	774 968	2	774 977	1	774 1009	1	774 1018	1	774 1019	1	774 1055	1	774 1056	1	774 1068	1	774 1069	1	774 1070	1	774 1203	1	774 1214	1	774 1240	1	774 1246	1	774 1321	1	774 1359	1	774 1397	1	774 1401	1	774 1407	1	774 1417	1	774 1445	1	774 1451	1	774 1451	1	774
