Tests on Abstracts Journals:  Coverage Overlap and Indexing .A Martyn, J. In a previous paper (J. Doc. 20 (4) 1964, 212-35) a series of tests on the coverage, overlap, and indexing of abstracts journals were described. Briefly, these were carried out by selecting recent, comprehensive bibliographies on specific subjects, searching the appropriate abstracts journals via the author indexes to determine the number of references given in the bibliography that were abstracted, then consulting the subject indexes to try to locate those references which are known to have been abstracted.  A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and the results are reported here. Our results are presented below in the following form: 1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references, reports, etc.). 2. Abstracts journals consulted. 3. Coverage and multiple coverage.  This is a bar-chart showing number of references not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on. 4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last column showing coverage by all services combined.  (Where bar-charts are given they show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography, actual numbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns. 5. Taking each abstracts journal separately, we show the headings under which references were found in the subject index.  Some references we were unable to locate, so there is often an apparent discrepancy with the figures given in 4. .X 2	1	776 4	1	776 65	2	776 158	1	776 162	1	776 359	1	776 361	1	776 371	1	776 382	1	776 458	1	776 475	1	776 513	2	776 545	1	776 580	1	776 582	2	776 591	1	776 613	1	776 622	1	776 658	1	776 685	1	776 686	1	776 691	1	776 696	1	776 705	1	776 721	1	776 722	1	776 725	1	776 728	1	776 729	1	776 759	3	776 760	2	776 765	2	776 770	8	776 775	2	776 776	16	776 782	1	776 815	1	776 967	1	776 981	1	776 1030	1	776 1076	1	776 1097	3	776 1098	2	776 1157	1	776 1176	2	776 1182	1	776 1208	1	776 1209	1	776 1275	1	776 1290	1	776 1404	1	776 1414	1	776 1432	1	776 1432	1	776
