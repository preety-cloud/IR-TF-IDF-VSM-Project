Evaluating the Economic Efficiency of a Document Retrieval System .A Lancaster, F. W. .A Climenson, W. D. A retrieval system may be evaluated strictly in terms of user satisfaction (operating efficiency), or it may be evaluated from the point of view of efficient means of satisfying user requirements (economic efficiency).. When we consider the relationship between operating efficiency and economic efficiency, we are faced with a whole series of possible trade-offs.. There may be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs.. The problem is to determine the most economical path to follow.. Pay-off factors, break-even points, and diminishing returns must be taken into consideration.. This paper considers some of these factors in relation to various parts of the complete retrieval system: the acquisition subsystem, the indexing subsystem, the index language, the searching subsystem, and the equipment subsystem.. .X 61	1	779 62	1	779 65	1	779 67	1	779 70	1	779 71	1	779 72	1	779 73	1	779 75	1	779 76	1	779 135	1	779 153	2	779 156	1	779 175	2	779 206	1	779 207	1	779 208	1	779 213	1	779 214	1	779 217	1	779 243	1	779 249	1	779 364	1	779 381	1	779 382	2	779 385	1	779 458	2	779 481	1	779 483	2	779 484	1	779 485	1	779 495	1	779 591	2	779 598	1	779 639	1	779 779	8	779 780	1	779 790	1	779 822	1	779 981	1	779 982	1	779 1055	1	779 1083	1	779 1086	1	779 1295	1	779 1297	1	779 1358	1	779 1402	1	779 1403	1	779 1410	1	779 1417	1	779 1417	1	779
