On-Line Access to Information: NSF as an Aid to the Indexer/Cataloger .A Bennet, John L. When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a traditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display formats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is directed toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equally useful to the searcher.. .X 24	1	78 26	1	78 30	1	78 68	1	78 71	2	78 72	1	78 73	1	78 74	1	78 75	3	78 77	4	78 78	10	78 79	3	78 80	2	78 81	3	78 82	3	78 83	2	78 86	1	78 153	1	78 154	1	78 156	1	78 175	2	78 177	1	78 180	1	78 211	1	78 212	2	78 245	1	78 247	1	78 277	1	78 279	1	78 280	1	78 281	1	78 336	1	78 420	1	78 483	1	78 486	1	78 498	1	78 501	1	78 562	1	78 581	1	78 593	1	78 595	1	78 666	1	78 720	1	78 748	1	78 785	1	78 786	1	78 787	1	78 788	1	78 789	1	78 790	1	78 791	1	78 838	1	78 852	1	78 853	2	78 854	1	78 855	1	78 925	1	78 984	2	78 1011	1	78 1118	1	78 1124	1	78 1131	1	78 1144	1	78 1294	1	78 1326	1	78 1382	1	78 1393	1	78 1431	1	78 1431	1	78
