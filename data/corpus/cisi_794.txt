'Half-Life' .A Vickery, B.C. .B V. 26 1970 The first diagram below gives a schematic view of a subject literature that is growing exponentially with time - the number of items published per year doubles in five years.  Each square of the paper represents a published item. The marks on the diagram represent current uses of the literature (say, citations made or items borrowed this year).  The inked squares are actual uses.  The dots are hypothetical uses - those that would occur if every published item had an equal chance of being used (in fact, every fifth item is dotted). .X 33	1	794 106	1	794 155	1	794 314	1	794 587	5	794 750	2	794 767	1	794 775	2	794 792	1	794 793	5	794 794	5	794 800	5	794 808	2	794 1222	1	794 1285	3	794 1287	1	794 1308	1	794 1308	1	794
