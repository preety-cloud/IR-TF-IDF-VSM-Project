Progress in Documentation .A Cleverdon, C. Thirty years or more ago, a favoured question in examination papers for librarians was some variation on the theme 'Compare the merits of a classified catalogue and an alphabetical subject catalogue'.  This was a subject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length, advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits, without ever stating a single demonstratable fact.  When, in the early 1950's, various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for indexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments.  In an editorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint, shared by many others, when he wrote:  Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems.  May the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems of the future.  There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and costs.  The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid intellectual discipline. .X 38	1	795 72	2	795 84	1	795 120	1	795 149	1	795 160	1	795 197	1	795 382	2	795 486	1	795 488	1	795 489	1	795 490	1	795 491	1	795 492	1	795 493	1	795 494	1	795 495	1	795 496	1	795 497	1	795 499	1	795 500	1	795 506	1	795 558	1	795 565	1	795 572	1	795 581	1	795 583	1	795 584	1	795 586	1	795 625	1	795 628	1	795 633	1	795 634	1	795 643	1	795 659	2	795 696	1	795 705	1	795 736	1	795 752	1	795 781	1	795 789	1	795 795	8	795 796	1	795 798	1	795 801	1	795 814	1	795 824	1	795 826	1	795 901	1	795 902	1	795 906	1	795 907	1	795 986	1	795 1089	1	795 1202	1	795 1209	1	795 1218	1	795 1250	1	795 1255	1	795 1289	1	795 1294	2	795 1414	1	795 1422	1	795 1422	1	795
