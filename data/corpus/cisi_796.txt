Switching Languages for Indexing .A Coates, E. J. The paper describes some properties of simple interconversion devices which enable material initially subject indexed by a particular indexing system to be made available to other institutions using different indexing languages in such a form as to be readily integrated into their indexes.. Reference is made to the outline Intermediate Lexicon which is the germinal form of a switching language for the field of information science.. Difficulties and problems in effecting satisfactory information transfer through such an interconversion scheme are explored, and suggestions made for the lines upon which further research needs to be undertaken.. The author was the Classification Research Group representative on the international working party concerned with the Intermediate Lexicon.. .X 16	1	796 114	1	796 154	2	796 159	1	796 194	1	796 212	1	796 257	1	796 429	1	796 458	1	796 489	1	796 493	1	796 498	1	796 501	1	796 582	1	796 583	1	796 627	1	796 653	1	796 655	1	796 688	1	796 770	1	796 795	1	796 796	6	796 797	1	796 798	2	796 801	1	796 802	4	796 838	1	796 902	1	796 906	1	796 907	1	796 914	1	796 989	1	796 1089	1	796 1209	1	796 1289	1	796 1294	1	796 1392	1	796 1405	1	796 1431	2	796 1448	1	796 1448	1	796
