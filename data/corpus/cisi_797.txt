Progress in Documentation .A Mills, J. Classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that care is needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application, such as information retrieval. Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevant to a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we think we want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to find more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  This implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.  The fact that the instrument we use to assist this operation may display quasi-classificatory features (e.g., alphabetical sequence) or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory store should not hide this otherwise obvious fact. .X 117	1	797 159	2	797 165	1	797 257	2	797 260	1	797 348	1	797 429	1	797 445	1	797 476	1	797 489	1	797 493	1	797 498	1	797 501	1	797 525	1	797 582	1	797 583	2	797 585	1	797 590	1	797 621	1	797 653	1	797 655	2	797 668	1	797 670	1	797 671	1	797 674	1	797 683	1	797 688	1	797 689	1	797 715	2	797 796	1	797 797	5	797 798	3	797 799	1	797 801	2	797 802	1	797 819	1	797 858	1	797 859	1	797 861	1	797 989	1	797 1077	1	797 1230	1	797 1231	1	797 1265	1	797 1393	1	797 1394	1	797 1405	1	797 1405	1	797
