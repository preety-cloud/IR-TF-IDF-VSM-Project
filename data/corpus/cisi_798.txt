The Thesaurofacet: A Multipurpose Retrieval Language Tool .A Aitchison, Jean A description is given of the English Electric 'Thesaurofacet', a faceted classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific, technical, and management subjects.. A novel feature of the system is the integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appears both in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term is displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships which cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers.. The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and computerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain traditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines for main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term concepts.. Methods of application of the Thesaurofacet in pre-coordinate and post-coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the techniques employed in its compilation.. .X 151	2	798 159	2	798 257	2	798 348	1	798 429	1	798 489	1	798 493	1	798 498	1	798 501	1	798 504	1	798 582	1	798 583	2	798 585	1	798 653	1	798 655	2	798 688	1	798 715	1	798 773	1	798 795	1	798 796	2	798 797	3	798 798	7	798 799	1	798 801	1	798 802	1	798 858	1	798 859	1	798 861	1	798 902	1	798 906	1	798 907	1	798 1089	1	798 1118	3	798 1122	1	798 1123	1	798 1133	1	798 1141	1	798 1163	1	798 1175	1	798 1209	1	798 1226	1	798 1230	1	798 1265	1	798 1289	1	798 1294	1	798 1393	1	798 1394	1	798 1405	1	798 1405	1	798
