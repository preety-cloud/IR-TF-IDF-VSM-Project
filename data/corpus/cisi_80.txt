A Graphic Catalog Card Index .A Lewis, Elizabeth M. To improve accessibility and maintenance of art slides in the United States Military Academy Library at West Point, a model card with a graphic image of the slide was designed with pertinent identifying information displayed directly above a black-and-white opaque photo and also key-punched into it.. The card serves for ample comparison reference previous to handling the slides and can produce a subject-arranged permuted index in book form.. The later permits access from the approach of form, geographic area, name, time of origin, artist, school, or style, etc.. Some added advantages, common to other kinds of graphic collections, are detailed.. Estimated costs of photo-reproduction of original cards, various kinds of copies, and computer time and materials are listed.. Future benefits from a consistent, unified cataloging system for graphic objects and the dissemination of this kind of information in a network structure are indicated as major goals.. .X 24	1	80 30	1	80 71	1	80 75	2	80 77	1	80 78	2	80 79	1	80 80	5	80 81	1	80 82	1	80 83	1	80 154	1	80 177	1	80 212	1	80 247	1	80 281	1	80 336	1	80 581	1	80 666	1	80 838	1	80 852	1	80 853	2	80 854	1	80 855	1	80 984	1	80 1011	1	80 1393	1	80 1431	1	80 1431	1	80
