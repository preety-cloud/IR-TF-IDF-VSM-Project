Progress in Documentation .A Foskett, D.J. The term 'informatics' was first advanced formally by the Director of Viniti, A.I. Mikhailov, and his colleagues A.I. Chernyi and R.S. Gilyarevskii, in their paper Informatics - new name for the theory of Scientific Information published at the end of 1966.  An English translation was circularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper, they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by Professor J.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information in which Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation', 'documentalistics', 'information science', and so on. Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that Informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information, only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitions for 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity', 'information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up their proposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, and the title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal, which is now called Informatiki. .X 3	1	803 15	1	803 20	1	803 42	1	803 60	1	803 85	2	803 129	1	803 152	1	803 172	1	803 228	1	803 313	1	803 345	1	803 361	1	803 447	1	803 449	1	803 456	1	803 457	1	803 469	1	803 505	1	803 574	1	803 585	2	803 599	2	803 607	1	803 625	1	803 640	1	803 652	1	803 665	2	803 762	1	803 803	7	803 911	1	803 1022	2	803 1045	1	803 1082	1	803 1218	1	803 1268	1	803 1309	2	803 1319	1	803 1386	1	803 1386	1	803
