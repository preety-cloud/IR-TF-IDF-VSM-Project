The Extension on Users' Literature Awareness as a Measure of Retrieval Performance, and Its Application to MEDLARS .A Miller, William L. The performance of a retrieval system with a file of only a few hundred references can be measured by assessing the relevance of each reference to each of a number of queries.. A suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the Recall ratio - the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the system.. When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not practicable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory.. Another measure of retrieval performance is the Extension ratio which is approximately the ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting a query to the retrieval system.. The properties of this measure are examined and it is applied to 315 MEDLARS searches.. .X 75	1	806 161	1	806 197	1	806 375	1	806 445	1	806 447	1	806 454	1	806 472	1	806 503	1	806 506	1	806 507	1	806 514	1	806 526	1	806 554	1	806 579	1	806 591	1	806 593	1	806 594	1	806 595	1	806 596	1	806 597	1	806 599	1	806 600	1	806 603	1	806 604	1	806 606	1	806 623	1	806 639	1	806 660	1	806 696	1	806 723	1	806 724	1	806 752	1	806 801	1	806 805	1	806 806	5	806 836	1	806 866	1	806 867	1	806 956	1	806 989	1	806 1298	1	806 1299	1	806 1327	1	806 1405	1	806 1405	1	806
