Free Text Word Retrieval and Scientist Indexing: Performance Profile and Costs .A Hersey, D. F. .A Foster, W. R. .A Stalder, E. W. .A Carlson, W. T. Comparative performance profiles were determined, by two independent scientific information centres, for on-line retrieval by means of (a) free text words and (b) subject indexing codes, from a data base of 4,600 descriptions of in-going research projects in four broad subject areas.. Altogether, thirty-nine questions that users had previously asked of the Science Information Exchange (SIE) of the Smithsonian Institution, and that were in the four subjects areas, were employed by SIE staff scientists, and twelve of these were independently used by staff members of the Biological Science Communication Project (BSCP) of the George Washington University.. Results of the two studies showed average recall values 30-40% higher, and relevance values 15-20% higher, for subject index code use as compared with text word use.. Advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are discussed.. .X 63	1	807 150	1	807 175	2	807 348	1	807 382	1	807 389	1	807 390	1	807 487	1	807 501	1	807 502	1	807 510	1	807 565	1	807 566	1	807 579	1	807 596	1	807 600	1	807 601	1	807 603	1	807 726	1	807 799	1	807 805	1	807 807	8	807 813	1	807 820	1	807 863	1	807 864	1	807 956	1	807 963	1	807 987	1	807 988	1	807 989	1	807 1152	1	807 1265	1	807 1294	2	807 1298	1	807 1327	2	807 1448	1	807 1448	1	807
