Measuring Readers' Failure at the Shelf .A Urquhart, John A. .A Schofield, J. L. This paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by the Library.. It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the non-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has already been installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out the degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library, the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand and not available.. They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for books that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of time, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure from one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the library.. From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library procedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of books failing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library.. The time spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given.. .X 4	2	811 5	2	811 9	2	811 32	1	811 33	1	811 96	1	811 115	1	811 137	1	811 163	1	811 207	7	811 217	1	811 222	1	811 223	1	811 234	3	811 245	2	811 267	1	811 296	1	811 297	1	811 298	1	811 300	1	811 301	1	811 302	1	811 358	1	811 364	3	811 365	1	811 456	1	811 502	3	811 515	1	811 535	1	811 614	1	811 625	1	811 629	1	811 631	1	811 634	1	811 638	2	811 651	1	811 748	1	811 751	1	811 764	2	811 765	1	811 766	1	811 768	1	811 774	1	811 778	1	811 783	2	811 786	1	811 791	2	811 793	1	811 799	1	811 800	1	811 811	14	811 816	7	811 818	2	811 823	2	811 842	2	811 843	1	811 844	1	811 846	1	811 913	1	811 915	1	811 925	4	811 944	1	811 948	3	811 959	1	811 960	1	811 961	3	811 962	3	811 963	3	811 964	3	811 968	1	811 983	1	811 994	3	811 1015	1	811 1019	1	811 1023	1	811 1068	1	811 1203	1	811 1242	1	811 1247	1	811 1257	1	811 1268	1	811 1321	1	811 1354	1	811 1400	1	811 1407	1	811 1445	1	811 1445	1	811
