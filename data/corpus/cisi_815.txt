Standard Times for Information Systems: A Method for Data Collection and Analysis .A Wilkin, A. P. .A Reynolds, R. .A Robertson, S. E. With a view of obtaining a set of standard times for information system operations, Aslib Research Department is developing and testing methods for collecting and analyzing data on the time taken to perform certain operations.. The current state of development of these methods is described.. Data collection is by a self-recording (diary) method, completed at the time of performing the operation.. The major problem is one of identifying, describing, and analyzing the effect of the various factors which might affect the time.. First results indicate that it is possible to explain a large proportion of the variations in individual times by taking account of a sufficient number of variables.. .X 2	1	815 5	1	815 90	2	815 91	1	815 158	2	815 222	2	815 223	2	815 231	1	815 261	1	815 295	1	815 299	1	815 334	1	815 354	1	815 368	1	815 435	1	815 496	1	815 608	1	815 610	1	815 615	1	815 617	1	815 620	1	815 770	1	815 776	1	815 792	1	815 815	7	815 842	1	815 938	1	815 939	1	815 945	1	815 957	1	815 991	1	815 992	1	815 1023	1	815 1219	1	815 1221	1	815 1227	1	815 1318	1	815 1365	2	815 1390	2	815 1414	1	815 1414	1	815
