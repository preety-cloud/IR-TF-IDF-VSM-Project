Measuring Readers' Failure at the Shelf in Three University Libraries .A Urquhart, John A. .A Schofield, J. L. This paper continues the reporting of the Unit's work on a method of investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the shelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find.. The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they were looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status, and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of failure for different groups of volumes.. A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library.. The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. These differences were reflected in the results obtained.. It is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own libraries.. .X 4	2	816 5	2	816 9	2	816 32	1	816 96	1	816 115	1	816 137	1	816 163	1	816 207	4	816 208	1	816 217	1	816 222	2	816 223	2	816 234	2	816 245	2	816 296	1	816 297	1	816 298	1	816 300	1	816 301	1	816 302	1	816 358	1	816 364	3	816 365	1	816 456	1	816 515	1	816 535	1	816 591	1	816 625	1	816 629	1	816 631	1	816 634	1	816 638	1	816 764	2	816 766	1	816 768	1	816 774	1	816 783	1	816 791	1	816 799	1	816 811	7	816 816	8	816 818	2	816 823	2	816 842	2	816 843	1	816 844	1	816 846	1	816 913	1	816 915	1	816 925	2	816 944	1	816 948	1	816 959	1	816 960	1	816 961	3	816 962	4	816 964	4	816 968	1	816 994	2	816 1015	1	816 1023	1	816 1068	1	816 1203	1	816 1242	1	816 1247	1	816 1257	1	816 1268	1	816 1321	1	816 1354	1	816 1400	1	816 1407	1	816 1445	1	816 1445	1	816
