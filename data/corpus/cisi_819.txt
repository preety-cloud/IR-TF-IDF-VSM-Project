Document Analysis and Linguistic Theory .A Gardin, Lean-Claude In this presentation I shell be concerned with only one aspect of information science and its relation with linguistics: namely document analysis.. 'Document analysis' is here understood in following sense: the extraction of meaning of documents - in the present case written documents.. We could define the latter without reference to the usual distinction between 'scientific literature' (the object of document analysis in information science) and other kinds of texts - historical records, myths, folklore, sacred writings, etc.).. Indeed, one of my theses in that there is little hope of understanding the kind of intellectual operations involved in the analysis of scientific documents, or questions pertaining to them other than through a study of textual analysis in general, as carried out in many disciplines - history, sociology, cultural anthropology, exegesis. etc. (Gardin, 1969).. For the purpose of this presentation, however, I shall concentrate on the handling of  scientific documents in the first, narrower sense, and only refer to other categories of texts in so far as they have been submitted to analytical processes of a comparable nature.. .X 117	1	819 146	1	819 165	1	819 168	1	819 333	1	819 445	1	819 449	1	819 476	1	819 498	1	819 525	1	819 530	1	819 553	1	819 572	1	819 574	1	819 590	1	819 621	1	819 628	1	819 668	1	819 670	1	819 671	1	819 674	1	819 683	1	819 689	1	819 715	1	819 790	1	819 797	1	819 802	1	819 819	5	819 830	1	819 874	1	819 877	1	819 878	1	819 940	1	819 941	1	819 992	1	819 993	1	819 995	1	819 1024	1	819 1027	1	819 1077	1	819 1079	1	819 1215	1	819 1216	1	819 1231	2	819 1421	1	819 1434	1	819 1435	1	819 1436	1	819 1443	1	819 1443	1	819
