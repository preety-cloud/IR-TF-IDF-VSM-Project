Recent Growth of the Literature of Biochemistry and Changes in Ranking of Periodicals .A Sengupta, I. N. The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research.. .X 48	1	821 167	1	821 189	1	821 193	1	821 195	1	821 196	1	821 198	1	821 201	2	821 219	1	821 379	1	821 588	1	821 614	2	821 616	1	821 635	1	821 638	2	821 685	1	821 735	1	821 748	1	821 753	1	821 756	1	821 757	1	821 775	1	821 787	1	821 792	1	821 821	5	821 831	1	821 905	1	821 952	1	821 953	1	821 1083	1	821 1210	1	821 1254	1	821 1256	1	821 1260	1	821 1275	3	821 1278	1	821 1290	1	821 1302	3	821 1352	1	821 1355	2	821 1369	2	821 1373	1	821 1397	1	821 1418	1	821 1418	1	821
