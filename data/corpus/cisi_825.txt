Progress in Documentation: The Development of Precis: A Theoretical and Technical History .A Austin, D. Before starting to trace the development of PRECIS to its theoretical beginnings I shall describe the system briefly in its present form.  This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not familiar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance of some of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how a machine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derived from a study of natural language, developed out of research into principles for a new general classification. PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings. Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index, PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature. Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the semantic sides of the system. .X 10	1	825 51	1	825 69	1	825 71	1	825 77	1	825 79	2	825 86	1	825 92	1	825 146	1	825 160	1	825 168	2	825 172	1	825 175	1	825 176	1	825 190	1	825 194	1	825 225	1	825 244	1	825 246	1	825 258	1	825 304	1	825 305	1	825 306	1	825 315	1	825 358	1	825 361	1	825 365	1	825 382	2	825 385	1	825 394	1	825 422	1	825 433	1	825 448	1	825 453	1	825 458	1	825 459	1	825 478	1	825 480	2	825 483	1	825 484	1	825 486	1	825 487	1	825 488	1	825 491	1	825 493	1	825 503	1	825 507	1	825 509	1	825 510	1	825 512	1	825 517	1	825 520	1	825 522	1	825 527	1	825 528	1	825 530	1	825 531	1	825 534	1	825 565	1	825 566	1	825 577	1	825 581	1	825 596	1	825 603	1	825 608	2	825 633	1	825 641	1	825 643	1	825 644	1	825 645	1	825 649	1	825 650	1	825 652	1	825 659	1	825 702	1	825 709	1	825 715	1	825 731	1	825 732	1	825 746	1	825 754	1	825 755	1	825 781	1	825 790	1	825 805	1	825 809	1	825 810	1	825 812	1	825 813	1	825 814	1	825 817	4	825 820	1	825 823	1	825 824	2	825 825	19	825 826	1	825 827	1	825 828	1	825 830	1	825 856	1	825 880	1	825 883	1	825 886	1	825 888	1	825 894	1	825 901	1	825 913	1	825 930	1	825 941	1	825 943	1	825 947	1	825 948	1	825 950	1	825 963	1	825 966	1	825 978	1	825 988	1	825 997	2	825 1004	1	825 1017	1	825 1024	2	825 1051	1	825 1054	1	825 1058	1	825 1061	1	825 1079	1	825 1146	2	825 1215	7	825 1216	2	825 1230	3	825 1257	2	825 1258	1	825 1266	1	825 1294	1	825 1327	1	825 1390	1	825 1394	1	825 1395	1	825 1419	1	825 1421	1	825 1427	1	825 1433	1	825 1441	2	825 1441	2	825
