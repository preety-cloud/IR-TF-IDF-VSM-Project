The Effect of a Large-Scale Photocopying Service on Journal Sales .A Line, Maurice B. .A Wood, D. N. The proposition is examined that large-scale photocopying, such as that practised by the British Library Lending Division, affects the sales of journals.. There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation figures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small.. It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on libraries.. .X 10	1	831 48	1	831 128	1	831 167	2	831 198	1	831 330	1	831 393	1	831 614	1	831 623	1	831 635	1	831 638	1	831 729	1	831 744	1	831 748	2	831 753	1	831 756	1	831 757	3	831 787	1	831 792	2	831 821	1	831 831	9	831 888	1	831 893	1	831 952	1	831 953	1	831 1083	1	831 1210	1	831 1241	1	831 1254	1	831 1256	1	831 1260	1	831 1275	1	831 1278	1	831 1302	1	831 1369	1	831 1373	1	831 1375	1	831 1376	1	831 1390	1	831 1418	1	831 1418	1	831
