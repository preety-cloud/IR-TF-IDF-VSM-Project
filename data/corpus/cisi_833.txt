A New Linear Notation System Based on Combinations of Carbon and Hydrogen .A Skolnic, Herman A new linear notation system is described which was designed to have a one-to-one correspondence with the chemical structures represented by the notations.. Each notation is unique and unambiguous, yet simple and compatible with computer input and output characters.. The symbols used in the notation system denote carbon in terms of bounds and attached hydrogen(s).. The notation system is illustrated with acyclic, carbocyclic, and heterocyclic examples.. .X 116	1	833 117	1	833 254	1	833 327	1	833 641	1	833 668	1	833 669	1	833 670	1	833 671	1	833 673	2	833 677	1	833 678	1	833 679	1	833 682	1	833 688	2	833 689	1	833 690	1	833 693	4	833 694	1	833 695	1	833 698	1	833 700	1	833 704	1	833 706	1	833 707	1	833 730	1	833 738	1	833 833	6	833 1026	2	833 1072	1	833 1261	2	833 1292	1	833 1452	2	833 1452	2	833
