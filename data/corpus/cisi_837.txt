Information Requirements in the Social Sciences: Some Preliminary Considerations .A Line, Maurice B. Information requirements in the social sciences are almost entirely unexplored.. I shall argue that exploration is desirable; discuss some of the reasons why this is so; attempt an analysis of the factors to be investigated; and consider some possible methods of investigation.. This article is an early by-product of the Investigation into Information Requirements of the Social Sciences, being carried out by two researchers under my direction,and supported by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information.. It is based on the Report on the Preliminary Stage, presented to OSTI in April, 1968.. .X 13	1	837 24	1	837 62	1	837 65	1	837 66	2	837 75	1	837 76	1	837 137	1	837 152	1	837 210	1	837 278	1	837 279	1	837 280	1	837 325	1	837 386	1	837 395	1	837 398	1	837 456	1	837 475	1	837 482	1	837 658	1	837 664	1	837 716	1	837 748	1	837 782	1	837 783	1	837 788	1	837 789	1	837 837	5	837 839	1	837 900	1	837 907	1	837 925	1	837 968	1	837 1083	1	837 1361	1	837 1400	1	837 1404	1	837 1404	1	837
