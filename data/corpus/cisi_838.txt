Prospects for a New General Classification .A Austin, Derec In traditional classification schemes, the universe of knowledge is broken down into self-contained disciplines which are further analysed to the point at which a particular concept is decated.. This leads to problems of: (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries.. (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects.. (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it fits as logically into one discipline as another.. Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears.. The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental relationships between concepts.. Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and Attributes as its vocabulary.. .X 16	1	838 30	1	838 71	1	838 75	2	838 77	1	838 78	1	838 79	1	838 80	1	838 81	1	838 82	1	838 83	1	838 154	4	838 159	1	838 212	1	838 247	1	838 257	2	838 476	1	838 477	3	838 581	1	838 653	2	838 666	1	838 796	1	838 802	1	838 838	9	838 853	1	838 898	2	838 989	1	838 1074	2	838 1075	2	838 1259	2	838 1391	4	838 1393	1	838 1395	1	838 1402	2	838 1429	4	838 1430	4	838 1431	2	838 1431	2	838
