Information Services in University Libraries .A Line, M.B. Development in university libraries in recent years in reader services, instruction in library use and subject specialization go only a small way to meeting the problems created by the "information explosion."  Reasons why more dynamic and personal information services for scientists and social scientists should be developed include the limitations in researchers' present use of libraries and information, the preference of users for informal channels of communication, increasing pressures on the time of university teachers, and problems associated with computer retrieval systems.  Specialist posts of information officer should be created as part of the library services, but with functions distinct from those of the librarian; difficulties that may arise with their location and operation are discussed.  The cost of information services in depth is heavy, but it may be possible to develop them within the existing budget by a reallocation of funds and staff duties.  .X 2	1	839 13	1	839 66	1	839 152	1	839 243	1	839 370	1	839 371	1	839 475	1	839 648	1	839 664	1	839 768	1	839 774	1	839 783	1	839 818	1	839 837	1	839 839	7	839 845	2	839 847	1	839 907	1	839 968	1	839 1246	1	839 1246	1	839
