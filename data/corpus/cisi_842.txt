Administrative Effectiveness: Times and Costs of Library Operations .A Smith, G. C. K. Schofield, J. L. The kinds of information needed by managing librarians to make correct decisions are considered, with emphasis on the value of current data on the exceptional situation.. Management information in a library is of greatest use in comparison, either internally, or with data from other libraries.. A simple, standard method of recording and costing is urged, so that librarians may readily identify procedures requiring improvement.. Development of the present costing method is traced from its original state as a simple management information system based on exception reporting (i.e. reporting the exceptions which occur in any particular survey), through a pilot study in a large university library, to its full installation in two further university libraries.. The method of analyzing the raw data is described, and examples of the tables are given, together with brief background information on the libraries concerned.. After a note on the limitations of the present costing method and of unit costs in general, unit times and costs are given for numerous operations in both the libraries surveyed, covering both reader and technical services.. There is agreement between results of several American studies and those of the present investigation.. For further comparison, the information on times and salaries has been used in conjunction with a standard civil service costing procedure.. .X 4	1	842 5	1	842 83	1	842 115	1	842 153	1	842 158	1	842 234	1	842 245	2	842 249	1	842 292	1	842 293	1	842 298	1	842 311	1	842 364	1	842 365	1	842 418	1	842 764	1	842 768	1	842 774	1	842 792	1	842 811	2	842 815	1	842 816	2	842 818	1	842 823	3	842 841	2	842 842	9	842 843	1	842 844	1	842 925	2	842 944	1	842 948	2	842 994	1	842 1023	1	842 1069	1	842 1070	1	842 1214	1	842 1232	1	842 1236	1	842 1242	1	842 1257	1	842 1317	2	842 1400	1	842 1401	1	842 1401	1	842
