Jesse Shera and the Theory of Bibliography .A Brookes, B.C. Twenty years ago Jesse Shera suggested that there was a need for a more analytical study of bibliography which might help to bridge library and information services.  Little note was taken of this proposal at the time but developments have since occurred and are here briefly reported.  It is argued that Shera's "macrobibliography" or "social epistemology" provides not only a subject for theoretical study but that it will also be needed for the rational design of library and information systems and networks of the near future. .X 3	1	846 9	1	846 207	1	846 222	1	846 223	1	846 296	1	846 297	1	846 298	1	846 300	1	846 301	1	846 302	1	846 358	1	846 364	1	846 515	1	846 535	1	846 625	1	846 629	1	846 631	1	846 634	1	846 791	1	846 811	1	846 816	1	846 818	1	846 823	1	846 843	1	846 844	1	846 846	5	846 911	1	846 915	1	846 961	1	846 962	1	846 964	1	846 994	1	846 1015	1	846 1242	1	846 1247	1	846 1268	1	846 1354	1	846 1354	1	846
