A Book Catalog at Stanford .A Johnson, Richard D. Description of a system for the production of a book catalog for an undergraduate library, using an IBM 1401 Computer (12K storage, 4 tape drives), an expanded print chain on the 1403 Printer, and an 029 Card Punch for input.. Described are the conversion of cataloging information into machine readable form, the machine record produced, the computer programs employed, and printing of the catalog.. The catalog, issued annually, is in three parts: an author title catalog, a subject catalog, and a shelf list.. Cumulative supplements are issued quarterly.. A central idea in the depiction of entries in the catalog is the abandonment of the main entry concept.. The alphabetical arrangement of entries is discussed: sort keys employed, filing order observed, symbols employed to alter this order, and problems encountered.. Cost factors involved in the preparation of the catalog are summarized.. .X 64	1	848 175	1	848 235	1	848 245	1	848 246	1	848 326	1	848 331	1	848 374	1	848 601	1	848 717	1	848 781	1	848 783	1	848 834	2	848 835	1	848 848	7	848 849	1	848 850	1	848 851	1	848 852	1	848 874	1	848 880	1	848 922	3	848 925	1	848 974	1	848 981	1	848 982	1	848 984	1	848 1042	1	848 1051	1	848 1152	1	848 1359	1	848 1415	1	848 1415	1	848
