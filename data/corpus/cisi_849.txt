The Development and Administration of automated systems in Academic Libraries .A De Gennardo, Richard The first part of this paper considers three general approaches to the development of an automation program in a large research library.. The library may decide simply to wait for developments; it may attempt to develop a total or integrated system from the start; or it may adopt an evolutionary approach leading to an integrated system.. Outside consultants,it is suggested, will become increasingly important.. The second part of the paper deals with important elements in any program regardless of the approach.. These include the building of a capability to do automation work, staffing, equipment, organizational structure, selection of projects, and costs.. .X 24	1	849 64	1	849 175	1	849 177	1	849 200	1	849 245	1	849 281	1	849 287	1	849 289	1	849 294	1	849 348	1	849 374	1	849 406	1	849 408	1	849 717	1	849 781	1	849 783	1	849 834	1	849 835	2	849 848	1	849 849	9	849 850	3	849 851	2	849 852	1	849 897	2	849 907	1	849 916	1	849 922	1	849 925	1	849 974	1	849 979	1	849 981	1	849 982	1	849 1007	1	849 1042	1	849 1051	1	849 1415	1	849 1415	1	849
