Information Science: Toward the Development of a True Scientific Discipline .A Yovits, M. C. It is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a "true" science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way.. In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that this model can be the basis for the development of a "true" science of information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use of this model and the definition of a "true" science, the goals and requirements for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this context, information is defined as data of value in decision making.. Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to specific observable actions which can be measured physically.. .X 20	1	85 42	1	85 60	2	85 85	8	85 129	1	85 172	1	85 457	1	85 469	1	85 574	1	85 585	2	85 599	1	85 640	1	85 652	1	85 665	1	85 762	1	85 803	2	85 1022	3	85 1037	2	85 1045	3	85 1077	1	85 1116	1	85 1161	1	85 1220	1	85 1268	1	85 1309	1	85 1309	1	85
