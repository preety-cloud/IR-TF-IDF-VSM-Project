Scope: A Cost Analysis of an Automated Serials Record System .A Koenig, Michael E. Finlay, Alexander C. Cushman, Joann G. Detmer, James M. A computerized serials record and control system developed in 1968/69 for the Technical Information Department of Pfizer Inc. is described and subjected to a cost analysis.. This cost analysis is conducted in the context of an investment decision, using the concept of net present value, a method not previously used in library literature.. The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value and a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically justifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and periodical titles).. It may be that the break-even point in terms of collection size required for successful automation of serial records is smaller than has been assumed to date.. .X 235	1	865 288	2	865 289	2	865 291	2	865 292	1	865 295	1	865 408	1	865 548	1	865 591	1	865 594	1	865 597	1	865 598	1	865 601	1	865 836	1	865 863	1	865 864	1	865 865	5	865 866	1	865 868	1	865 897	1	865 915	1	865 916	1	865 925	1	865 936	1	865 938	1	865 957	1	865 959	1	865 960	1	865 961	1	865 962	1	865 972	1	865 984	1	865 1052	1	865 1248	1	865 1353	1	865 1400	1	865 1401	1	865 1401	1	865
