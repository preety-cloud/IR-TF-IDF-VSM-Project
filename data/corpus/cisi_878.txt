The Ad Hoc Discussion Group on Serials Data Bases: Its History, Current Position, and Future .A Anable, Richard The Ad Hoc Discussion Group on Serials Data Bases was formed as a result of an informal meeting held during the American Library Association's Conference in Las Vegas on June 26, 1973.  Those in attendance were primarily interested in the generation and maintenance of machine-readable union files of serials.  (This author's involvement in that meeting and the later activities of the group stems from a contract between the National Library of Canada and York University concerning an investigation of the problems associated with machine-readable serials files.) .X 141	1	878 244	1	878 299	2	878 333	1	878 365	1	878 449	1	878 529	1	878 530	1	878 541	1	878 553	1	878 628	1	878 630	1	878 802	1	878 819	1	878 822	1	878 854	1	878 871	1	878 872	1	878 873	1	878 874	3	878 875	1	878 876	1	878 877	4	878 878	6	878 879	1	878 880	1	878 892	1	878 904	1	878 919	1	878 920	1	878 921	1	878 940	2	878 941	2	878 990	1	878 992	1	878 993	1	878 994	1	878 995	1	878 997	1	878 998	1	878 999	1	878 1000	1	878 1001	1	878 1002	1	878 1003	1	878 1013	1	878 1079	2	878 1143	1	878 1216	1	878 1230	1	878 1257	1	878 1303	1	878 1396	1	878 1421	1	878 1434	1	878 1435	2	878 1436	4	878 1441	1	878 1441	1	878
