State of the Nation in Networking .A Butler, B. There is little so ephemeral as a "Current review" in an area so rapidly changing as library networking.  Yet this very characteristic of rapid change makes valid the effort of providing an overview at a point in time. The first task, then, is network definition and description, necessary because a large number of library activities have been described as "networks" and only a limited number are covered here.  The chapter on "Library and Information Networks" in volume seven of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology provides a "normative list" of "essential characteristics": 1. A network's function is to marshal resources ... to accomplish results beyond the ability of any one of its members. 2. A network has developed an organizational design and structure that allows it to establish an identifiable domain.... 3. It has a base in communications technology. .X 115	1	885 123	1	885 141	1	885 335	1	885 342	1	885 363	1	885 400	1	885 409	1	885 434	1	885 459	2	885 505	1	885 594	1	885 598	1	885 643	1	885 644	1	885 645	2	885 646	1	885 647	1	885 651	1	885 739	1	885 826	1	885 872	1	885 879	1	885 881	2	885 882	2	885 883	2	885 884	2	885 885	9	885 886	1	885 887	2	885 888	1	885 917	1	885 921	1	885 947	1	885 972	1	885 999	1	885 1000	1	885 1001	1	885 1002	1	885 1003	1	885 1004	1	885 1016	1	885 1356	1	885 1368	1	885 1370	1	885 1372	1	885 1374	1	885 1375	2	885 1376	2	885 1377	1	885 1437	1	885 1437	1	885
