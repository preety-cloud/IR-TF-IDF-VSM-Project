Serials Data Control:  Current Problems and Prospects .A Fasana, P. This paper will describe three areas of current serials activity which are of importance to conventional libraries.  I would like to do this in general terms, eschewing details which only seem to serve to confuse.  The three areas are: l. Standards.  What they are, what impact they can have, what influence they currently are having on serials processing. 2. Standards Setting Projects. I will attempt to describe and/or define the almost incestuous intricacies of the National Serials Data Program (NSDP), the International Serials Data System (ISDS), and CONSER (CONversion of SERials). 3. Code Revision Activities.  I will outline the influence that current standards and projects are having on code revision activities. My comments are to be considered within the context of conventional libraries, primarily one wherein card catalogs still exist and manual processes are the rule. .X 128	1	888 172	1	888 342	1	888 365	1	888 453	1	888 560	1	888 646	1	888 647	1	888 652	2	888 823	1	888 825	1	888 827	1	888 831	1	888 856	1	888 881	2	888 882	2	888 885	1	888 886	1	888 888	6	888 904	1	888 913	1	888 919	1	888 921	1	888 943	1	888 963	1	888 999	1	888 1000	1	888 1001	2	888 1002	1	888 1003	2	888 1004	2	888 1060	1	888 1241	1	888 1257	1	888 1258	1	888 1291	1	888 1315	1	888 1340	1	888 1433	1	888 1437	1	888 1441	1	888 1445	1	888 1445	1	888
