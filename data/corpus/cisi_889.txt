A Comprehensive Study Based on Physics Abstracts .A Keeman, S. The Documentation Research Project of the American Institute has been engaged for some years in an effort to improve the various systems available for the publication and dissemination of physics literature.  Numerous aspects of the problem have been studied and much information has been obtained from the projects listed in the bibliography which appears on the inside cover of this Report.  Studies which resulted in the determination of the indexing requirements of research physicists, new methods for the content analysis and indexing of physics research papers, and better production methods for journal indexes have formed the backbone of the work which has as its ultimate objective the creation of a reference retrieval system which is adequate for the physicists who will use it. .X 55	1	889 147	1	889 161	1	889 201	1	889 203	1	889 373	1	889 379	2	889 560	1	889 614	1	889 748	2	889 760	1	889 778	2	889 889	6	889 977	1	889 1085	1	889 1118	1	889 1203	1	889 1256	1	889 1352	1	889 1397	1	889 1404	1	889 1418	1	889 1418	1	889
