An Experiment in Index Term Frequency .A Svenonius, Elaine This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its "breadth" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the "optimal" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely "reasonable" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior.. .X 44	1	894 51	1	894 57	2	894 69	1	894 71	1	894 75	1	894 77	2	894 79	2	894 86	1	894 168	1	894 175	3	894 176	2	894 315	1	894 329	2	894 382	2	894 389	1	894 390	1	894 416	1	894 448	2	894 450	1	894 466	1	894 480	1	894 483	1	894 484	1	894 486	1	894 488	1	894 491	1	894 493	1	894 503	1	894 507	1	894 509	1	894 510	1	894 511	1	894 512	1	894 514	1	894 517	1	894 520	2	894 521	1	894 522	1	894 527	1	894 528	1	894 531	2	894 565	4	894 566	1	894 567	1	894 570	1	894 572	1	894 576	1	894 581	1	894 586	1	894 595	1	894 596	2	894 603	1	894 608	3	894 619	1	894 633	1	894 636	1	894 643	1	894 659	3	894 715	1	894 754	1	894 790	1	894 791	1	894 805	1	894 809	1	894 810	4	894 812	3	894 813	2	894 814	3	894 817	2	894 820	1	894 824	1	894 825	1	894 870	1	894 875	1	894 894	6	894 928	1	894 963	1	894 990	1	894 991	1	894 1051	1	894 1255	1	894 1294	2	894 1313	1	894 1327	2	894 1413	1	894 1419	2	894 1427	1	894 1445	1	894 1445	1	894
