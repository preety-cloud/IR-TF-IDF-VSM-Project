Classification Systems .A Soergel, D. The field of documentation originated from the desire of librarians to arrange the document collection by subject areas.  Mono-Dicraredical Classification systems were developed for this purpose which made it possible in each case to find a single clearly defined category for each bibliographic item.  The development of modern science has brought about two principal changes in the situation: First it is no longer enough to simply provide for the retrieval of complete bibliographic items as a unit, but rather one tends more and more to request informational details that may be contained in the book. Second, modern knowledge has become too complex and interdependent that it is no longer possible to provide a single well-defined category for the books or journal articles. .X 154	1	898 165	1	898 477	2	898 530	1	898 621	1	898 641	1	898 653	1	898 838	2	898 898	6	898 1074	1	898 1075	1	898 1231	1	898 1259	1	898 1391	2	898 1402	1	898 1429	2	898 1430	2	898 1430	2	898
