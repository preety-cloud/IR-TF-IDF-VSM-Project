Technical Scientific Information and the Efficient Application of Science .A Mikhailov, A. The intense development of science and its immediate application in production is one of the characteristic feelings of our time. The growth of the economy now depends more and more on the speed of scientific research. One of the main tasks of the five-year plan (1971-1975) is to develop in every possible way basic and applied scientific research and to rapidly introduce their results into the national economy. The Directives of the 24th Congress of the CPSU emphasize the need to improve scientific-technical information, and to guarantee the systematic transfer to interested fields and institutions of information on scientific achievements and progressive experimentation in the areas of technology, the organization of production, and production management. .X 899	6	899 1093	1	899 1094	1	899 1095	1	899 1104	1	899 1112	1	899 1178	1	899 1223	1	899 1223	1	899
