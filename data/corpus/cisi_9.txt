Access to Libraries in College .A Hyman, R.T. This study assumed that an additional use study held less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts. The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire. Findings of the documentary analysis included the following: Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed. Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization. Definitions of "browsing" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research. .X 4	1	9 9	5	9 32	1	9 96	1	9 137	1	9 163	1	9 207	2	9 222	1	9 223	1	9 296	1	9 297	1	9 298	1	9 300	1	9 301	1	9 302	1	9 358	1	9 364	1	9 456	1	9 515	1	9 535	1	9 625	1	9 629	1	9 631	1	9 634	1	9 768	1	9 774	1	9 783	1	9 791	1	9 799	1	9 811	2	9 816	2	9 818	1	9 823	1	9 843	1	9 844	1	9 846	1	9 913	1	9 915	1	9 961	2	9 962	2	9 964	2	9 968	1	9 994	1	9 1015	1	9 1068	1	9 1203	1	9 1242	1	9 1247	1	9 1268	1	9 1321	1	9 1354	1	9 1407	1	9 1445	1	9 1445	1	9
