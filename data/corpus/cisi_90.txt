Involving, Computerizing, Personalizing .A Kilgour, F. In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement of entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless. The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries. Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid "service." Libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques. .X 5	1	90 33	1	90 36	1	90 90	7	90 91	1	90 158	1	90 161	1	90 183	1	90 184	1	90 193	1	90 199	1	90 201	1	90 202	1	90 203	1	90 204	1	90 205	1	90 209	1	90 212	1	90 217	1	90 220	1	90 222	2	90 223	1	90 231	1	90 261	1	90 284	1	90 286	1	90 289	1	90 294	2	90 295	1	90 299	1	90 334	1	90 348	1	90 354	1	90 368	1	90 435	1	90 543	1	90 553	1	90 588	1	90 608	1	90 610	1	90 612	1	90 613	1	90 615	1	90 617	2	90 620	2	90 624	1	90 799	1	90 800	1	90 808	1	90 815	2	90 868	2	90 869	1	90 872	1	90 897	1	90 938	1	90 939	1	90 957	1	90 959	1	90 963	1	90 990	1	90 991	1	90 992	1	90 1023	1	90 1151	1	90 1196	2	90 1197	1	90 1219	1	90 1221	2	90 1227	1	90 1229	1	90 1318	1	90 1365	2	90 1390	2	90 1390	2	90
