Periodicals for the Small Bio-Medical and Clinical Library .A Hunt, J.W. Since the advent of periodical literature in the seventeenth century well over ten thousand journals have been published in the field of bio-medicine.  Many of these have ceased publication; others are only of local interest.  Still, approximately two thousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currently released.  As research and discovery are recorded in the journal literature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is its subscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomes a major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of experimental data available to their readers.  When funds are limited, the selection of a periodical collection that will best serve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramount importance.  A plan of highly selective purchasing must be adopted to prevent the improper use of funds.  Actual needs of the library must be at hand to carry out such a plan. .X 31	1	905 33	1	905 36	2	905 41	3	905 46	1	905 89	1	905 97	1	905 102	1	905 111	1	905 112	1	905 163	1	905 181	1	905 182	1	905 183	2	905 184	2	905 189	1	905 193	3	905 195	3	905 196	2	905 198	2	905 199	2	905 201	2	905 203	2	905 210	1	905 219	1	905 221	1	905 225	1	905 269	2	905 359	1	905 373	1	905 395	1	905 415	2	905 545	1	905 552	1	905 587	1	905 605	1	905 613	1	905 614	2	905 638	2	905 735	1	905 747	1	905 748	1	905 750	1	905 753	1	905 760	1	905 766	1	905 767	3	905 774	1	905 775	2	905 778	1	905 782	1	905 784	1	905 788	1	905 789	1	905 793	1	905 800	1	905 808	1	905 821	1	905 891	1	905 905	5	905 952	2	905 953	2	905 964	1	905 968	1	905 977	1	905 983	1	905 1009	1	905 1016	1	905 1018	1	905 1019	1	905 1023	1	905 1030	1	905 1055	1	905 1071	2	905 1087	1	905 1090	1	905 1135	1	905 1147	1	905 1240	1	905 1260	1	905 1275	4	905 1276	1	905 1278	1	905 1280	1	905 1285	1	905 1286	1	905 1287	1	905 1302	4	905 1335	1	905 1355	1	905 1359	1	905 1369	1	905 1390	1	905 1397	3	905 1417	2	905 1428	1	905 1432	1	905 1432	1	905
