Libraries at Large .A Knight, D.M. This book, Libraries at Large, is itself one tangible outcome of Advisory Commission activity, representing the combined efforts of Duke University, the R.R. Bowker Company, members of the Commission and its several study groups, and many other diverse individuals within and without the library world.  The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of our Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individual in our society be provided with library and informational services adequate to his current and emerging needs.  Confronting this goal requires a recognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.  The national interest demands simultaneous sympathy with people in pockets of illiteracy and people in the vanguards of intellectual achievement. .X 22	1	908 122	1	908 358	1	908 855	1	908 903	1	908 907	1	908 908	5	908 937	1	908 1005	1	908 1011	1	908 1056	1	908 1056	1	908
