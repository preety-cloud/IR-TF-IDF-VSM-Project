Libraries and Neighborhood Information Centers .A Kromes, C.L. It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-city service that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link between community residents and social agencies.  The major question is whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened social service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library in this role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation for impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and is not committed to any particular action program, community service or clientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize, update and disseminate information. .X 248	1	910 340	1	910 376	1	910 431	1	910 910	5	910 935	1	910 939	1	910 1006	1	910 1017	1	910 1049	1	910 1145	2	910 1227	1	910 1236	1	910 1384	1	910 1396	1	910 1396	1	910
