Libraries and the Organization of Knowledge .A Shera, J.H. From time to time, in the course of its historical development, a professional activity enters a new stage.  This usually takes place as the culmination of a series of modifications to the practice of the art, arising out of changes in the social situation in which the profession operates. Skilled workers, sensitive to changing needs, alter or refine their practice so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself.  Descriptive accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature; and, from time to time, a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these explanations into a system, or theory, which gives a rational account of what is going on, and so prepares the way forward. This is what Dean Jesse H. Shera has set out to do in this collection of his essays and addresses. .X 3	1	911 111	1	911 112	1	911 113	1	911 146	1	911 199	1	911 231	1	911 352	1	911 360	1	911 361	1	911 383	1	911 457	1	911 458	1	911 487	1	911 665	1	911 803	1	911 846	1	911 911	9	911 966	1	911 1053	1	911 1073	1	911 1152	1	911 1231	1	911 1309	1	911 1393	1	911 1393	1	911
