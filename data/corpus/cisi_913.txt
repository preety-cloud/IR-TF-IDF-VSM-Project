On the construction and care of white elephants .A Grose, M.W. Line M.B. Although catalogue codes and standards have received much attention, there has been very little fundamental questioning of cataloguing principles and practice.  Basic questions in need of investigation include: whether individual libraries need catalogues of their own stock; how far printed  bibliographies could serve as a substitute; the functions catalogues are serving at present, and the actual demands placed on them; the nature of users and non-users, and the possible conflicts between the catalogue needs of librarians and non-librarians; the psychological factors of approachability and usability; whether standardization should over-rule local needs; whether catalogues should be designed for use by readers at all; the functions of printed national catalogues; the implications of increased co-operation and of the changing functions of libraries; what a catalogue entry should contain and how it should be arranged; and the possible administrative uses of catalogue data. Mechanization has made these questions of great urgency. .X 4	1	913 9	1	913 32	1	913 96	1	913 137	1	913 163	1	913 172	1	913 207	1	913 365	1	913 453	1	913 456	1	913 652	1	913 768	2	913 774	1	913 783	2	913 799	1	913 811	1	913 816	1	913 825	1	913 856	1	913 872	1	913 886	1	913 888	1	913 913	5	913 943	1	913 961	1	913 962	1	913 963	1	913 964	1	913 968	1	913 970	1	913 1004	1	913 1068	1	913 1203	1	913 1257	1	913 1258	1	913 1321	1	913 1407	1	913 1433	1	913 1434	1	913 1441	1	913 1445	1	913 1445	1	913
