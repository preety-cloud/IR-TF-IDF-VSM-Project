Library Automation:  Experience, Methodology, and Technology of the Library as an Information System .A Heiliger, E.M. The goal of this book, Library Automation: Experience, Methodology, and Technology of the Library as an Information System, is to provide a perspective of the library functions that have been or might be mechanized or automated, an outline of the methodology of the systems approach, an overview of the technology available to the library, and a projection of the prospects for library automation. There is a concern in every library for the proper handling and control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and convenient fulfillment of service demands.  That concern is matched by excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers and communications network in many library functions.  Knowledge, the library's stock-in-trade, is being generated at an unprecedented rate and sought after with unprecedented intensity.  Technology, the driving force behind the library's problems and one hope for future solution, is being advanced to unprecedented levels. .X 119	1	916 177	1	916 178	1	916 214	1	916 235	1	916 241	1	916 287	2	916 289	1	916 291	1	916 348	1	916 406	2	916 408	3	916 548	1	916 594	1	916 597	1	916 598	1	916 601	1	916 836	1	916 849	1	916 863	1	916 864	1	916 865	1	916 866	1	916 868	1	916 897	2	916 916	5	916 925	1	916 936	1	916 959	1	916 960	1	916 962	1	916 979	1	916 986	1	916 1007	2	916 1012	1	916 1033	1	916 1052	1	916 1084	1	916 1248	1	916 1400	1	916 1400	1	916
