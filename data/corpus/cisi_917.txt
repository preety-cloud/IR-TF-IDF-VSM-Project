Library Automation Systems .A Salmon, S.R. This book is intended as a reasonably comprehensive discussion of library automation systems for the librarian without previous knowledge or experience in the field, and for the intelligent layman. Library automation systems, in the context of this work, are combinations of electronic data processing machines and appropriate programs and operating procedures, organized to work together in carrying out, with a minimum of human intervention, some well-defined library process.  It is a field that many thoughtful observers feel has reached a certain maturity, and so deserves to have its portrait made. .X 141	1	917 363	1	917 409	1	917 645	1	917 647	1	917 651	1	917 739	1	917 881	1	917 882	1	917 883	1	917 884	1	917 885	1	917 886	1	917 887	1	917 917	8	917 999	1	917 1000	1	917 1001	1	917 1002	1	917 1003	1	917 1004	1	917 1375	1	917 1376	1	917 1376	1	917
