Library of Congress .A Goodrum, C.A. The book was built on interviews with the Library's middle managers, on discussions with working specialists in the various divisions, on conversations with and questionnaires sent to out-of-Library users, and from my own observations through almost twenty-five years in the Library's Congressional Research Service.  After the text was completed, it was read by appropriate people in each department for factual content and ultimately by the staff in the Librarian's Office for their comment.  At no point was there pressure to change text or conclusions - although there were plenty of good-natured suggestions on details, and nearly everyone urged a fuller description of his own particular specialty! .X 8	1	918 20	1	918 171	1	918 909	1	918 918	6	918 1061	1	918 1453	1	918 1453	1	918
