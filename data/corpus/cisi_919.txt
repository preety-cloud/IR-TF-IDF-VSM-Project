ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials .A Spalding, C. S. The International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts, convened in Copenhagen in 1969 under the auspices of the IFLA Committee on Uniform Cataloguing Rules (later Committee on Cataloguing), set in motion the first major development in continuation of the success achieved by the Paris International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (1961) in the matter of the principles and general rules for entry and heading.  Taking under consideration the study of "Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications.  There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them.  These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings.  The working group succeeded in its task and brought forth its provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard edition was published earlier this year.  The success of this standard is manifested by the continuing increase in the number of countries that have adopted it. .X 10	1	919 121	1	919 128	1	919 246	1	919 265	1	919 331	1	919 541	3	919 560	1	919 646	1	919 647	1	919 652	1	919 799	1	919 823	1	919 827	1	919 873	1	919 877	1	919 878	1	919 881	2	919 888	1	919 904	1	919 919	5	919 920	4	919 921	3	919 922	1	919 999	1	919 1000	1	919 1001	1	919 1002	1	919 1003	2	919 1013	1	919 1291	1	919 1315	1	919 1340	1	919 1441	1	919 1445	2	919 1445	2	919
