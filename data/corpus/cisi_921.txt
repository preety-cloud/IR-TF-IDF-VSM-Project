CONSER Cooperative Conversion of Serials Project .A Upham, L. The final report from the Association of Research Libraries' ad hoc Committee on Machine-Based Serials, written in January of this year, showed that of the 86 libraries which participated in the  committee's survey of efforts in the area of machine-readable serials files, 64 had files containing a total of 1,723,568 titles.  Twenty-two libraries reported having no files and one library indicated that it was in the process of converting its file.  The cost of converting these files is approximately $1,500,000, not to mention the utilization of an incredible amount of duplicate conversion effort. .X 10	1	921 121	1	921 541	3	921 873	1	921 877	1	921 878	1	921 881	4	921 882	2	921 885	1	921 888	1	921 904	1	921 919	3	921 920	3	921 921	5	921 999	1	921 1000	1	921 1001	1	921 1002	1	921 1003	1	921 1013	1	921 1441	1	921 1441	1	921
