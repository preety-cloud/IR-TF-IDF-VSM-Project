Library Education and Training .A Bonn, G.S. The Conference on Library Education and Training in Developing Countries was arranged in order (1) to examine more closely the present facilities, curricula, and programs for training library workers in the developing countries of the world closest to Hawaii, those in East and South Asia; (2) to determine their short- and long-range needs for trained library workers; and (3) to determine their needs for additional library education and training facilities and for revised curricula.  In the light of this information the Conference proposed to evaluate the assistance given in recent years by American advisors and temporary library school faculty in these countries, and then to ascertain the roles that both local library schools and their counterparts in the United States can play in serving the needs for trained library workers in these and other developing countries. .X 339	1	924 371	1	924 387	1	924 923	1	924 924	9	924 1403	1	924 1403	1	924
