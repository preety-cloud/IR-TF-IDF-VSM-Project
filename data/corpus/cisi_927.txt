Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers .A Green, S.S. When scholars and persons of high social position come to a library, they have confidence enough, in regard to the cordiality of their reception, to make known their wishes without timidity or reserve. Modest men in the humbler walks of life, and well-trained boys and girls, need encouragement before they become ready to say freely what they want. A hearty reception by a sympathizing friend, and the recognition of some one at hand who will listen to inquiries, even although he may consider them unimportant,  make it easy for such persons to ask questions, and put them at once on a  home footing. .X 274	1	927 353	1	927 926	2	927 927	5	927 1017	1	927 1028	1	927 1263	1	927 1357	1	927 1357	1	927
