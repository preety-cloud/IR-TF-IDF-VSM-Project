Top Priority for Cataloging-In-Source .A Wheeler, J.L. After a century of public library service and progress, public libraries attract less than a third, perhaps only a quarter of the adult population, either to read and borrow books, or to look up information. But nearly 60 per cent of the population is over 21. Currently a few large city libraries show slight decreases in  annual circulation, the major measure of their usefulness.  Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last decade.  Possibly  because the number of public, college, university, and special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968 (Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969).  And there are more than that many school libraries. .X 92	1	930 246	1	930 249	1	930 825	1	930 883	1	930 930	8	930 931	1	930 941	1	930 950	1	930 978	1	930 987	1	930 988	2	930 997	1	930 1043	1	930 1079	1	930 1216	1	930 1393	1	930 1393	1	930
