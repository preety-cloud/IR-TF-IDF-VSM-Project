Library Cost Analysis:  A Recipe .A Kountz, J. Unforgivably, time has passed since the days when the library's patron was the local monarch and cost was no deterrent.  Time's passage has replaced the monarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost has attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs may stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the profession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost accounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis. In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate requirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the six steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future. .X 90	1	938 231	1	938 249	1	938 250	1	938 261	1	938 288	1	938 289	1	938 295	2	938 299	1	938 334	1	938 354	1	938 365	1	938 408	1	938 608	1	938 610	1	938 617	1	938 620	1	938 815	1	938 865	1	938 938	5	938 939	1	938 959	1	938 974	1	938 984	1	938 991	1	938 992	1	938 1221	1	938 1317	1	938 1318	1	938 1352	1	938 1365	1	938 1390	1	938 1390	1	938
