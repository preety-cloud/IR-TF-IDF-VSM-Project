Pay Libraries & User Charges .A De Gennaro, R. The battle lines are being drawn for a great debate over the emotionally and politically charged issue of how library and information services are to be funded in the coming decades. Most librarians will be on the side of "conservatism" and "democracy," favoring the continuation of traditional modes of tax-supported public library service with information freely available to all as a matter of right.  Information industry people, publishers, government officials, engineers, and even, perhaps, authors will be on the side of "progress" and "profits," advocating a new concept of for-profit or pay libraries, user charges, and information as a salable commodity. .X 10	1	942 145	1	942 152	1	942 167	1	942 234	1	942 304	1	942 306	1	942 338	1	942 526	1	942 551	1	942 646	1	942 647	1	942 651	1	942 879	1	942 942	8	942 943	1	942 944	1	942 947	1	942 948	1	942 1009	1	942 1017	1	942 1049	1	942 1206	1	942 1237	1	942 1258	1	942 1305	1	942 1306	1	942 1378	1	942 1390	1	942 1440	1	942 1450	1	942 1453	1	942 1453	1	942
