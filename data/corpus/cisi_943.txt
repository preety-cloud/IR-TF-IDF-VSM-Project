Austerity, Technology, and Resource Sharing: Research Libraries Face the Future .A De Gennaro, R. During the last two decades academic libraries, in parallel with their parent institutions, experienced the greatest period of growth and affluence that they have ever known.  The watchword was "more" - more money, more books and journals, more staff, more space, and more technology.  Many new research libraries were created, and those that already existed experienced unprecedented growth.  Although libraries got more of everything during those years, they still could not keep pace with the growth of new fields of research, new doctoral programs, and the increasing production of books and journals.  Two decades of affluence not only failed to help solve the many problems that were brought on by exponential growth - they exacerbated them. .X 46	1	943 115	1	943 128	1	943 129	1	943 130	1	943 167	1	943 172	1	943 183	1	943 192	1	943 196	1	943 215	1	943 219	1	943 221	1	943 223	1	943 225	1	943 232	1	943 234	2	943 277	1	943 280	1	943 290	1	943 304	1	943 306	1	943 338	1	943 365	1	943 393	1	943 415	1	943 453	1	943 468	1	943 494	1	943 639	1	943 646	2	943 647	2	943 651	2	943 652	1	943 765	1	943 818	1	943 822	1	943 823	1	943 825	1	943 827	1	943 856	1	943 886	1	943 888	1	943 913	1	943 925	1	943 942	1	943 943	9	943 944	3	943 948	1	943 963	1	943 1004	1	943 1017	1	943 1021	1	943 1023	2	943 1049	1	943 1070	1	943 1071	1	943 1085	1	943 1203	1	943 1206	1	943 1237	1	943 1257	1	943 1258	1	943 1302	1	943 1374	1	943 1378	1	943 1390	1	943 1401	1	943 1433	1	943 1437	1	943 1440	1	943 1441	1	943 1450	2	943 1453	1	943 1453	1	943
