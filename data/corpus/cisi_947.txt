Library Networks .A Goldstein, S. The combination of computers and communications technology is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S. And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more effective ways. It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library's function is to parcel out information, and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed. In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts, state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely copied by the others. .X 10	2	947 115	1	947 167	1	947 190	1	947 225	1	947 244	1	947 304	1	947 305	1	947 306	1	947 335	1	947 342	1	947 358	1	947 385	1	947 393	1	947 394	1	947 433	1	947 434	2	947 459	1	947 529	1	947 534	2	947 551	1	947 639	1	947 643	1	947 644	1	947 645	1	947 647	1	947 651	1	947 702	1	947 731	1	947 732	1	947 817	1	947 820	1	947 823	1	947 825	1	947 826	1	947 827	1	947 828	1	947 885	1	947 942	1	947 947	7	947 948	1	947 1017	1	947 1058	1	947 1059	1	947 1060	1	947 1146	1	947 1230	1	947 1257	1	947 1258	1	947 1305	1	947 1306	1	947 1374	1	947 1390	2	947 1437	1	947 1441	1	947 1441	1	947
