The Crisis in Cataloging .A Osborn, A.D. A wise German librarian has linked the library administrator and the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy in work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library's resources.  This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of cooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards. It is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectives setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be destroyed than are created. This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled "Tasks for the future."  There was a time, and not so very far back, when the library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.  In the more immediate past, however, the two have become separated, so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down as a task for the future, the immediate future at that. Many new problems of administration have served to busy the administrator, and most catalogers have had more work than enough, with the result that administrators have come to know less and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know less and less about general library administration.  The situation now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem field. .X 92	2	950 235	1	950 246	2	950 247	1	950 262	1	950 326	1	950 333	2	950 825	1	950 883	1	950 930	1	950 940	1	950 941	2	950 950	5	950 978	3	950 988	1	950 991	1	950 996	1	950 997	2	950 1000	1	950 1079	1	950 1153	1	950 1216	2	950 1266	1	950 1395	1	950 1441	1	950 1441	1	950
