The Historical Background of Departmental and Collegiate Libraries .A Thompson, L. In spite of the great volume of material dealing with departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in library periodicals and books on university and college library administration, there has been relatively little original thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to provide an adequate background for solution of problems which have their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literature has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against this type of library organization or statements of how this or that institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except for contemporary accounts of early American scholars describing the attempts to transplant the German seminar library to American soil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is no account of the conditions which brought about and for many years invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation of trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last three-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators who are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, or amalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution. .X 96	1	951 297	1	951 298	1	951 304	1	951 951	5	951 952	1	951 1183	1	951 1339	1	951 1365	1	951 1365	1	951
