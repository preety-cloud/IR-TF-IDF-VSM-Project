Characteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists and Physicists in the United States .A Fussler, H.H. The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books! .X 14	1	952 19	1	952 31	1	952 36	1	952 37	2	952 39	1	952 40	1	952 41	1	952 46	1	952 47	1	952 48	1	952 88	1	952 96	1	952 97	1	952 102	1	952 103	1	952 132	1	952 137	1	952 167	1	952 181	1	952 182	1	952 183	1	952 184	1	952 189	1	952 193	1	952 195	1	952 198	2	952 201	1	952 221	1	952 233	1	952 237	1	952 253	1	952 255	1	952 269	1	952 272	1	952 297	1	952 298	1	952 313	1	952 359	2	952 377	1	952 379	1	952 395	2	952 415	2	952 505	1	952 543	1	952 560	1	952 573	1	952 614	2	952 618	1	952 632	1	952 635	2	952 638	2	952 667	1	952 735	1	952 748	3	952 749	1	952 751	1	952 753	1	952 756	1	952 757	1	952 760	1	952 764	1	952 765	1	952 767	3	952 772	1	952 774	1	952 775	1	952 777	1	952 778	2	952 782	1	952 787	1	952 792	1	952 804	1	952 805	1	952 821	1	952 831	1	952 891	1	952 893	1	952 905	2	952 951	1	952 952	10	952 953	4	952 958	1	952 964	1	952 968	1	952 1009	1	952 1016	1	952 1018	1	952 1019	1	952 1030	1	952 1061	1	952 1071	1	952 1083	1	952 1085	1	952 1086	2	952 1087	1	952 1182	1	952 1200	1	952 1210	2	952 1235	1	952 1240	1	952 1254	1	952 1256	1	952 1260	3	952 1274	1	952 1275	6	952 1276	2	952 1277	1	952 1278	2	952 1280	2	952 1287	1	952 1301	1	952 1302	6	952 1304	1	952 1313	1	952 1338	1	952 1339	1	952 1344	1	952 1347	1	952 1359	1	952 1365	1	952 1369	1	952 1373	1	952 1380	1	952 1397	1	952 1417	1	952 1418	1	952 1428	1	952 1444	1	952 1444	1	952
