The Librarian:  From Occupation to Profession? .A Goode, W.J. An industrial society has an open class stratification system; it offers some an opportunity to rise, but it offers no guarantee against downward social mobility.  Compared to other types of societies, this one demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual in his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills of a high order. Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to rise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income. .X 22	1	954 230	1	954 237	1	954 301	1	954 348	1	954 923	1	954 934	1	954 954	9	954 1056	1	954 1333	1	954 1423	1	954 1423	1	954
