Interrelations among Special Librarys .A Budington, W.S. The present paper will first deal with some of the objectives, etiology, and requirements of the library network as it overtakes and embraces co-operation. Next, in this context of network development, a number of activities involving special libraries will be reviewed by way of illustration and example.  The greatest proportion of special library interrelationships are, on the surface at least, random and  informal.  We shall therefore concentrate on such arrangements as have about them some measure of structure and intent. Finally, we will deduce from these examples the performance and promise which special libraries may offer to a total library network or information system. .X 24	1	955 74	1	955 75	1	955 119	2	955 122	2	955 336	1	955 340	1	955 431	1	955 684	1	955 939	1	955 955	5	955 967	1	955 982	1	955 1009	1	955 1011	2	955 1361	1	955 1390	1	955 1424	1	955 1451	1	955 1451	1	955
