An Economic Analysis of Library Benefits .A Goddard, Haynes C. Libraries find it increasingly necessary to use their limited resources in the most efficient manner.. This requires the use of decision rules which permit library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest returns.. An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society..
