The Review Article: Its Characteristics and Problems .A Virgo, Julie A. The characteristics and problems associated with the review literature in the sciences were examined.. Three major classes of review articles were identified: (1) the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the contributions made within the previous year, (2) the critical review which selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem, and (3) data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken.. The role and control of the review article in medicine was described.. Over the past fifteen years, the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has been on the order of 1:38.. Possible solutions to a number of problems associated with the review literature are discussed, such as the selection of articles for review..Further examination of some critical questions relating to the production and organization of reviews will have to be undertaken before the review, as a means of bringing the most significant information to its users, will be accepted as a reliable adjunct to the original publications.. .X 39	1	958 43	1	958 47	1	958 50	2	958 65	1	958 75	1	958 91	1	958 326	1	958 429	1	958 446	1	958 473	1	958 485	1	958 503	1	958 513	1	958 572	1	958 582	1	958 586	1	958 588	1	958 589	1	958 603	1	958 613	1	958 614	1	958 616	1	958 618	1	958 632	1	958 657	1	958 685	1	958 686	1	958 691	1	958 718	1	958 719	2	958 721	1	958 722	1	958 724	1	958 725	1	958 773	1	958 778	1	958 791	1	958 952	1	958 953	1	958 958	7	958 987	1	958 988	1	958 1207	1	958 1208	1	958 1235	1	958 1283	1	958 1293	1	958 1302	1	958 1426	1	958 1426	1	958
