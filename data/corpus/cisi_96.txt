Communication Patterns in Applied Technology .A Marquis, D.G. Allen, T.J. The preceding papers have addressed themselves to the study of information flow in a particular stream of human activity which has been variously called science, pure science, basic research, or fundamental research, and which is only secondarily, if at all, concerned with the practical utilization of its products. At this point it is appropriate to note that there is a parallel activity which includes applied research, exploratory development, and engineering development. This second stream of research we will call technology. Far more is known about the flow of information among scientists than among technologists.  From the knowledge that is available, however, we are led to conclude that the communication patterns in the two areas of activity are not only largely independent of one another, but qualitatively different in their nature.  This difference is reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by which information is diffused within the two sets of practitioners.  The present paper is addressed to these differences and to a discussion of the nature of the communication process between science and technology. .X 4	1	96 9	1	96 32	1	96 96	6	96 123	1	96 131	1	96 137	1	96 152	1	96 163	1	96 207	1	96 297	1	96 298	1	96 439	1	96 440	1	96 456	1	96 658	2	96 768	1	96 771	1	96 774	1	96 783	1	96 799	1	96 811	1	96 816	1	96 913	1	96 951	1	96 952	1	96 961	1	96 962	1	96 964	1	96 968	1	96 1030	1	96 1068	1	96 1154	1	96 1203	1	96 1285	1	96 1321	3	96 1339	1	96 1365	1	96 1386	1	96 1407	1	96 1408	1	96 1445	1	96 1445	1	96
