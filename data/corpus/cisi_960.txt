Library Operations Research: A Process of Discovery and Justification .A Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F. This article begins with a discussion of the broad role of operations research (O.R.) in a society undergoing change.. The nature of O.R. terms in a library environment is then considered.. The function of models in O.R. is analyzed, the development of a model being contrasted with its formal presentation.. Criteria for good models are suggested.. This article then focuses on storage models for libraries, first considering the Dewey classification system from this perspective and then summarizing more current research carried out under the direction of the author with a grant from the National Science Foundation.. .X 4	1	960 5	1	960 175	1	960 178	1	960 207	1	960 245	1	960 287	1	960 288	1	960 291	2	960 292	1	960 364	1	960 406	1	960 408	1	960 471	1	960 591	1	960 660	1	960 766	1	960 810	1	960 811	1	960 816	1	960 865	1	960 915	1	960 916	1	960 925	4	960 957	1	960 959	3	960 960	6	960 961	3	960 962	3	960 964	1	960 972	1	960 984	1	960 1007	1	960 1033	1	960 1219	1	960 1353	1	960 1400	3	960 1401	1	960 1401	1	960
