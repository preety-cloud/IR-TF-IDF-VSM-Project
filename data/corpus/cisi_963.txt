Catalog use in a Large Research Library .A Lipetz, Ben_Ami Concern with the questions of when and how best to computerize the catalog of a large research library, and how to improve an existing conventional catalog, motivated a study of the utilization of the main catalog of the Yale University Library.. The study was carefully designed to provide a representative sample of catalog use.. Traffic through the catalog area was observed over a period of more than a year.. A schedule of interviews with catalog users was based on observed traffic volume by hour of day, day of week, and time of year.. More than 1,000 interviews were completed, using nonleading interviewing technique.. Information was derived on the catalog user's objective, starting clues, and university affiliation.. Search success was determined.. Follow-up studies were performed on the catalog cards and the actual books identified in successful searches.. Reasons for search failure were determined for know-item searches.. Availability and accuracy of different categories of search clues were ascertained.. Published algorithms for searching computerized bibliographic files were evaluated.. Attention is given to the feasibility of automatic construction of computerized catalogs.. Some of the available results are presented and discussed.. .X 57	1	963 63	1	963 75	1	963 90	1	963 172	1	963 175	1	963 176	1	963 207	1	963 209	1	963 234	1	963 245	1	963 249	1	963 276	1	963 289	1	963 294	1	963 326	1	963 329	1	963 331	1	963 348	1	963 350	1	963 365	1	963 389	1	963 390	1	963 453	1	963 487	1	963 502	3	963 553	1	963 565	1	963 572	1	963 579	1	963 595	1	963 596	2	963 600	1	963 601	1	963 608	1	963 612	1	963 617	1	963 619	1	963 620	1	963 652	1	963 783	1	963 799	1	963 805	1	963 807	1	963 810	1	963 811	3	963 812	1	963 813	1	963 814	1	963 825	1	963 856	1	963 863	1	963 864	1	963 870	1	963 886	1	963 888	1	963 894	1	963 913	1	963 925	2	963 928	2	963 943	1	963 948	1	963 956	1	963 963	9	963 973	1	963 987	1	963 988	1	963 989	1	963 990	2	963 991	1	963 994	1	963 1004	1	963 1152	1	963 1221	1	963 1229	1	963 1255	1	963 1257	1	963 1258	1	963 1265	1	963 1294	1	963 1327	1	963 1400	1	963 1413	1	963 1433	1	963 1441	1	963 1445	1	963 1445	1	963
