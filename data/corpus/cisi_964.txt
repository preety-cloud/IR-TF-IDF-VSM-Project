Efficiency Criteria for the Operation of Large Libraries .A Meier, R.L. It is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited for the testing of theoretical hypotheses. Librarians and their assistants respect research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in helping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in most instances) of the usefulness of such research for the improvement of their own organizations. Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices; therefore, significant results can often be obtained with smaller samples and in shorter periods of observation.  People working in libraries do not feel they should curtail disclosures about basic processes.  Elsewhere professional employees are obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative committees.  At least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or more libraries almost always lie close at hand - there could hardly be any more convenient institution. .X 4	2	964 5	1	964 9	2	964 31	2	964 32	1	964 36	1	964 41	1	964 46	2	964 96	1	964 137	1	964 163	1	964 181	1	964 182	1	964 183	1	964 184	1	964 193	1	964 195	1	964 198	1	964 201	1	964 206	2	964 207	5	964 208	3	964 217	1	964 222	2	964 223	2	964 245	2	964 266	2	964 269	1	964 277	1	964 282	1	964 289	1	964 296	1	964 297	1	964 298	1	964 300	1	964 301	1	964 302	1	964 358	1	964 364	2	964 395	1	964 408	1	964 415	1	964 456	1	964 515	1	964 535	1	964 591	2	964 625	1	964 629	1	964 631	1	964 634	1	964 760	1	964 766	1	964 767	1	964 768	1	964 774	2	964 778	1	964 783	1	964 791	1	964 799	1	964 811	3	964 816	4	964 818	1	964 823	1	964 843	1	964 844	1	964 846	1	964 891	1	964 905	1	964 913	1	964 915	1	964 925	2	964 948	1	964 952	1	964 953	1	964 959	1	964 960	1	964 961	3	964 962	4	964 964	9	964 968	2	964 976	1	964 994	1	964 1005	1	964 1009	1	964 1015	1	964 1018	1	964 1019	1	964 1068	1	964 1203	1	964 1240	1	964 1242	1	964 1247	1	964 1268	1	964 1321	1	964 1354	1	964 1359	1	964 1397	1	964 1400	2	964 1407	1	964 1417	1	964 1445	1	964 1445	1	964
