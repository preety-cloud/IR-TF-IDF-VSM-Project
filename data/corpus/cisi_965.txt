The Information Needs of Current Scientific Research .A Menzel, H. The information demands, or information needs, of current scientific research are similar in many respects to the information needs in other forms of scholarship.  But this is not true in all cases, and the focus of this paper is on the needs of the research scientists.  In discussing the information needs of the scientist, I shall not limit myself to those for which library work is immediately relevant; in fact, a good part of this paper will call attention to the importance of those aspects of scientific communication that take place outside libraries and, indeed, outside literature. (There are, of course, very few aspects of scientific communication to which library work is not at least indirectly relevant.) .X 41	1	965 50	1	965 131	1	965 132	1	965 147	1	965 202	1	965 395	1	965 771	1	965 772	1	965 891	1	965 907	1	965 928	1	965 965	6	965 973	1	965 1037	1	965 1099	1	965 1158	1	965 1187	1	965 1330	1	965 1408	1	965 1408	1	965
