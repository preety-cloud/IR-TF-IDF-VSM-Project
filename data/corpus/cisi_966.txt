The Evidence Underlying the Cranfield Results .A Swanson, D.R. An indexing or classification system should be judged by the retrieval results it produces, namely, the extent to which it brings forth relevant material and rejects the irrelevant.  Thus, well-designed experiments should permit judging the relative merits of different classification schemes. This notion, although self-evident, had remarkably little impact on the field of library science prior to the 1950's.  During that decade, the first controlled experiments on information retrieval were performed, and these mark a turning point in the history of classification research.  For the first time, experimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical importance to indexing and classification. It is my purpose here to review some aspects of the most notable of these experimental tests - the ASLIB Cranfield Research Project. .X 50	1	966 79	1	966 131	1	966 146	1	966 175	1	966 361	1	966 382	4	966 389	1	966 458	1	966 474	1	966 608	1	966 769	1	966 773	1	966 780	1	966 785	1	966 825	1	966 911	1	966 956	1	966 966	7	966 997	1	966 1053	1	966 1084	1	966 1216	1	966 1255	3	966 1266	1	966 1282	1	966 1361	1	966 1393	1	966 1395	1	966 1421	1	966 1421	1	966
