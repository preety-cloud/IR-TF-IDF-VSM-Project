Fields of Information on Library of Congress Catalog Cards: Analysis of a Random Sample, 1950-1964 .A Avram, H.D. Guiles, K.D. Meade, G.T. The Information Systems Office (ISO) of the Library of Congress has as its mission the development and implementation of the main automation program for the Library and the co-ordination of all LC automation efforts. One of the primary activities in this effort is a system-development study concentrating on the central bibliographic operations, that is, acquisitions, cataloging, reference, etc.  This study is now in its early stages, and it is too soon to predict the actual system that will evolve. As an adjunct to this study an analysis of the potential uses of and problems involved in the machine processing of cataloging data was begun.  One aspect of the analysis was the design of a preliminary machine- readable catalog record.  The results of this work are in a report issued by the ISO as its "Planning Memorandum Number 3." .X 159	1	970 178	1	970 206	1	970 208	1	970 309	1	970 408	1	970 416	1	970 477	1	970 502	1	970 768	1	970 783	1	970 791	1	970 852	2	970 854	1	970 857	1	970 858	1	970 859	1	970 861	1	970 872	1	970 913	1	970 970	5	970 976	1	970 1007	1	970 1043	1	970 1252	1	970 1317	1	970 1395	1	970 1434	1	970 1445	1	970 1445	1	970
