Paper Impermanence as a Consequence of pH and Storage Conditions .A Smith, R.D. This article aims to provide some basic information, references to further information, and a sense of proportion about the action of hydrogen ions and storage conditions on paper.  Other  important causes of paper deterioration, such as oxidative degradation, biological attack, photocatalyzed degradation, and mechanical wear and tear, will not be considered at this time. .X 337	1	971 969	3	971 971	6	971 1211	1	971 1211	1	971
