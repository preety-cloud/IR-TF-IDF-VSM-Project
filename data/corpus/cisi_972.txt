Graph Model for Library Information Networks .A Korfhage, Robert R. .A Bhat, U. Narayan .A Nance, Richard E. The design and study of library information networks are enhanced by the use of the concepts which have been developed by graph theorists.. In this paper we expand upon this theme, proposing a general network structure which we believe to be a good model for a wide variety of library and other information networks.. The basic concepts from graph theory are illustrated with the aid of a hypothetical Public Library Access Network (PLAN).. .X 288	1	972 291	1	972 292	1	972 433	1	972 459	1	972 505	1	972 591	1	972 594	1	972 598	1	972 602	1	972 647	1	972 654	2	972 855	1	972 865	1	972 885	1	972 915	1	972 925	1	972 957	1	972 959	1	972 960	1	972 961	1	972 962	1	972 972	5	972 984	1	972 1353	1	972 1385	1	972 1400	1	972 1401	1	972 1401	1	972
