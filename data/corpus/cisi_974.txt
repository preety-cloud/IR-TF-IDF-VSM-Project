Cost Survey: Cost of Ordering, Cataloging, and Preparations in Southern California Libraries .A MacQuarrie, C. It was our original intention to include the cost of book selection with the cost of ordering, as part of the total acquisition process.  We also attempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few of the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct cost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion. .X 249	1	974 250	1	974 331	1	974 365	1	974 408	1	974 834	1	974 848	1	974 849	1	974 922	1	974 938	1	974 974	5	974 984	2	974 997	1	974 1317	1	974 1359	1	974 1359	1	974
