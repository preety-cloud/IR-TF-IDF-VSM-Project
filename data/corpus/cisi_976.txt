Cost Accounting for the Library .A Brutcher, C. Gessford, G. Rixford, E. Increasingly, librarians have felt the need for more accurate cost data.  The prime reason for this need has been in the development and presentation of the budget which is the instrument used to determine and obtain the funds for the library's forthcoming fiscal period. Since libraries do not charge for the service they render their users, they must derive the funds necessary for their operations and growth from supporting bodies such as federal, state, or local governments, private institutions, and industrial firms. .X 27	1	976 74	1	976 83	1	976 178	1	976 206	3	976 207	1	976 208	2	976 245	3	976 266	1	976 273	1	976 277	1	976 279	2	976 282	1	976 288	2	976 331	1	976 381	1	976 408	4	976 490	1	976 496	1	976 591	2	976 592	1	976 723	1	976 724	1	976 834	1	976 860	1	976 925	2	976 957	1	976 962	1	976 964	1	976 970	1	976 975	1	976 976	7	976 1005	1	976 1007	1	976 1148	1	976 1183	1	976 1227	1	976 1317	2	976 1353	1	976 1359	1	976 1360	2	976 1400	3	976 1410	1	976 1424	1	976 1424	1	976
