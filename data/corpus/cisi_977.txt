A Study of the Usage and Retention of Technical Periodicals .A Strain, P.M. Limited physical space expansion, an administrative consideration in every library, becomes a stringent factor in the planning of special libraries.  While public and college libraries may have several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a building or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library.	Weeding or storage requirements, therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study made by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals has potential for other libraries. .X 2	1	977 31	1	977 33	2	977 36	1	977 41	1	977 46	1	977 76	1	977 89	1	977 97	1	977 102	1	977 111	1	977 112	1	977 132	1	977 137	1	977 139	1	977 152	1	977 155	1	977 163	1	977 183	3	977 184	1	977 193	2	977 195	1	977 199	1	977 201	3	977 203	4	977 204	1	977 205	1	977 210	2	977 225	1	977 269	2	977 367	1	977 373	3	977 475	1	977 545	1	977 552	2	977 587	1	977 605	1	977 613	1	977 614	2	977 638	2	977 735	1	977 747	1	977 750	1	977 753	1	977 759	1	977 760	1	977 766	1	977 767	3	977 774	1	977 775	2	977 782	1	977 784	1	977 788	2	977 789	2	977 793	1	977 800	1	977 808	1	977 889	1	977 905	1	977 953	1	977 977	7	977 983	2	977 1016	1	977 1023	1	977 1030	2	977 1055	2	977 1056	1	977 1087	1	977 1090	1	977 1135	1	977 1203	2	977 1256	1	977 1260	1	977 1275	1	977 1276	1	977 1278	1	977 1280	1	977 1285	1	977 1286	1	977 1287	1	977 1302	1	977 1335	1	977 1352	3	977 1369	1	977 1390	1	977 1397	2	977 1417	1	977 1428	1	977 1432	1	977 1451	2	977 1451	2	977
