Remarks on LC Plans for Implementation of New Centralized Acquisitions and Cataloging Program under Title IIC, Higher Education Act .A Cronin, J.w. The general purpose of my part in this program discussion is to report to you on the new program of centralized acquisitions and cataloging to be undertaken by the Library of Congress under authorization granted under Title IIC of the Higher Education Act of 1965.  By this action, the Congress took two most important steps to aid libraries of higher education in the United States: (1) it fully recognized for the first time, the importance of granting Federal aid and assistance toward solving the problem of cataloging in this country; and (2) it gave the Library of Congress a clear mandate to provide new and unparalleled services for the benefit of academic and research libraries of this country. .X 92	1	978 200	1	978 246	1	978 262	1	978 825	1	978 883	1	978 930	1	978 940	1	978 941	2	978 950	3	978 978	5	978 988	1	978 996	1	978 997	1	978 1079	1	978 1216	1	978 1252	1	978 1252	1	978
