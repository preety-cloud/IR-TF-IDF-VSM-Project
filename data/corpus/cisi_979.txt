Automated Acquisitions Procedures at the University of Michigan Library .A Dunlap, C. In June 1965, the Acquisitions Department of The University of Michigan Library began using a computer-based system for ordering books and other library materials.  This is the beginning of an over-all automated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designed with the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from the University's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on the automated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr. Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  After the preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies were made.  Current (i.e., 1964) volume and costs were compared with anticipated volume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems. .X 64	1	979 177	1	979 200	2	979 211	1	979 281	1	979 287	1	979 348	1	979 406	1	979 408	3	979 849	1	979 850	1	979 897	1	979 916	1	979 979	5	979 1007	1	979 1051	1	979 1051	1	979
