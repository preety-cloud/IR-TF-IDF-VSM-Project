Scientific Communication: Its Role in the Conduct of Research and Creation of Knowledge .A Garvey, W.D Griffith, B.C. There is considerable apprehension today within the scientific community over the communication crisis in science.  The present article, which attempts to clarify certain aspects of the problem, overviews the data collected by the APA Project on Scientific Information Exchange in Psychology, together with data which we have more recently obtained relative to other disciplines. Such a reexamination of the data should help to clarify APA's relationship to the many information media involved in the communication process which begins with research and ends with the incorporation of research findings into psychological knowledge. .X 48	2	98 89	1	98 95	1	98 98	6	98 100	1	98 105	1	98 107	1	98 109	1	98 111	1	98 359	1	98 386	1	98 398	1	98 439	2	98 440	1	98 456	2	98 533	2	98 544	1	98 602	1	98 1062	1	98 1063	1	98 1083	1	98 1085	1	98 1284	1	98 1285	1	98 1289	1	98 1291	1	98 1296	3	98 1300	1	98 1301	1	98 1302	1	98 1338	1	98 1408	1	98 1408	1	98
