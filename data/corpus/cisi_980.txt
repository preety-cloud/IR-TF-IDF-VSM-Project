Facsimile Transmission in Libraries:  A State of the Art Survey .A Schatz, S. Facsimile transmission is the rapid transmission of printed pages from one point to another using electronic devices.  All facsimile transmission methods require converting the original picture into an electrical impulse which is then transmitted over telephone lines, private lines, microwave, or a combination of these communication links.  The receiving unit reconverts the electrical impulse into an exact duplicate of the original document on a screen or in the form of a hard copy. .X 59	1	980 63	1	980 175	1	980 355	1	980 408	1	980 481	1	980 482	1	980 686	1	980 717	1	980 718	1	980 719	1	980 850	1	980 980	6	980 1042	1	980 1051	1	980 1410	3	980 1415	1	980 1426	1	980 1426	1	980
