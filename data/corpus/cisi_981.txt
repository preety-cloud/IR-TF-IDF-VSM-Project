Statistics of Collection Overlap at the Libraries of the Six New England State Universities .A Nugent, W.R. As part of a design study to specify a regional processing center for the New England state university libraries, it was required to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect to each of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries.  Participating states were Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.  This overlap data was needed to predict the degree of joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of collective reclassification. The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections, showing, for example, that a random title from one library had a 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library. When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%. Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest duplication elsewhere. .X 4	1	981 61	1	981 64	1	981 65	1	981 67	1	981 70	1	981 71	1	981 72	1	981 73	1	981 135	1	981 162	1	981 175	2	981 206	1	981 207	1	981 208	1	981 245	1	981 249	2	981 250	1	981 271	1	981 282	1	981 290	1	981 295	1	981 374	1	981 382	1	981 394	1	981 458	1	981 481	1	981 483	1	981 485	1	981 580	1	981 601	1	981 622	1	981 696	1	981 705	1	981 717	1	981 728	1	981 729	1	981 770	1	981 776	1	981 779	1	981 780	1	981 781	1	981 783	1	981 834	1	981 835	1	981 848	1	981 849	1	981 850	1	981 851	2	981 852	1	981 862	1	981 863	1	981 872	1	981 922	1	981 925	2	981 981	11	981 982	2	981 984	1	981 1013	1	981 1042	1	981 1051	1	981 1197	1	981 1247	1	981 1257	1	981 1268	1	981 1358	1	981 1390	1	981 1402	1	981 1410	2	981 1415	1	981 1417	1	981 1417	1	981
