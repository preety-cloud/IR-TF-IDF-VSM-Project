Logical Flow Charts and Other New Techniques for the Administration of Libraries and Information Centers .A Gull, C.D. The widespread introduction of electronic digital computer systems for information processing has produced significant advances in management theory and practice in recent years. For example, two management devices, PERT and CPM, undeveloped and impractical before computers, have been basic to the success of our outer space program.  It is perhaps overlate in library development, but appropriate in this memorial to Miss Esther J. Piercy, to explore the application of new management knowledge and practice to the administration of libraries and information centers, and to sketch some directions in which research could be undertaken to benefit the management of information. .X 61	1	982 64	1	982 67	1	982 70	1	982 71	1	982 72	1	982 73	1	982 135	1	982 175	2	982 206	1	982 207	1	982 208	1	982 245	2	982 291	1	982 374	1	982 382	1	982 458	1	982 481	1	982 483	1	982 485	1	982 717	1	982 779	1	982 780	1	982 781	1	982 783	1	982 834	1	982 835	1	982 848	1	982 849	1	982 850	1	982 851	1	982 852	1	982 922	1	982 925	2	982 945	1	982 955	1	982 961	1	982 967	1	982 981	2	982 982	5	982 1042	1	982 1051	1	982 1317	1	982 1358	2	982 1359	1	982 1360	1	982 1361	1	982 1400	1	982 1401	1	982 1402	2	982 1410	1	982 1415	1	982 1417	1	982 1417	1	982
