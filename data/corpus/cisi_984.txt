Cost Analysis Studies in Libraries: Is There a Basis for Comparison? .A Dougherty, R.M. When the Chairman of the Technical Services Cost Committee asked the three of us to summarize the findings of the Colorado study on centralized processing, I agreed.  Later, I began to have second thoughts - I suppose because we were almost buried under an avalanche of data and it soon became apparent that we could not really summarize the findings of the study in one evening. The investigation took off in tangents that had not been originally anticipated.  As you have already been informed, the final report deals with such diverse topics as a faculty user attitude survey, mathematical model simulations of processing center operations, approval plan utilization, and an inter-institutional bookkeeping system, all in addition to the cost studies of acquisitions and cataloging in nine libraries. .X 24	1	984 71	1	984 72	1	984 73	1	984 74	1	984 75	2	984 77	1	984 78	2	984 79	1	984 80	1	984 81	1	984 82	1	984 83	1	984 86	1	984 153	1	984 156	1	984 177	1	984 211	1	984 212	1	984 245	1	984 249	1	984 250	1	984 277	1	984 279	1	984 280	1	984 281	1	984 288	1	984 291	1	984 292	1	984 331	1	984 336	1	984 365	1	984 408	1	984 486	1	984 591	1	984 601	1	984 720	1	984 748	1	984 785	1	984 786	1	984 787	1	984 788	1	984 789	1	984 791	1	984 834	2	984 848	1	984 851	1	984 852	1	984 853	1	984 854	1	984 855	1	984 860	1	984 862	1	984 863	1	984 865	1	984 915	1	984 922	1	984 925	2	984 938	1	984 957	1	984 959	1	984 960	1	984 961	1	984 962	1	984 972	1	984 974	2	984 981	1	984 984	7	984 1011	1	984 1013	1	984 1197	1	984 1317	1	984 1353	1	984 1359	1	984 1400	1	984 1401	1	984 1401	1	984
