MEDLARS:  A Summary Review and Evaluation of Three Reports .A Stevens, N.D. The MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) system at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has over the past few years been one of the most significant and one of the most publicized automated bibliographic information retrieval systems.  Over two hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world, and in a variety of library journals.  The publicity that has attended this project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments.  There has to date been very little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50 percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report, and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS system.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall value cannot help but be colored by this connection. .X 38	1	986 84	1	986 119	1	986 147	1	986 210	1	986 213	1	986 214	2	986 218	1	986 241	1	986 250	1	986 340	1	986 348	1	986 355	1	986 375	1	986 381	1	986 382	1	986 408	1	986 488	1	986 489	1	986 490	1	986 491	2	986 492	1	986 493	1	986 494	1	986 495	1	986 496	1	986 497	1	986 499	1	986 500	1	986 506	1	986 581	1	986 583	1	986 584	1	986 586	2	986 591	1	986 603	1	986 608	1	986 610	1	986 659	1	986 676	1	986 696	1	986 763	1	986 788	1	986 795	1	986 801	1	986 855	1	986 916	1	986 986	6	986 1012	2	986 1050	1	986 1084	1	986 1188	1	986 1254	1	986 1291	1	986 1294	1	986 1379	1	986 1404	1	986 1404	1	986
