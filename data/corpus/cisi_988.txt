Report on Library of Congress Plans for Cataloging in Publication .A Welsh, W.J. When we were asked in October 1969 for an expression of attitude about a renewal of cataloging-in-source, our response was positive. We were interested and we were determined to make it succeed.  Profiting from the experience gained in the 1958-59 experiment, we specified that: 1. A survey of libraries be conducted; 2. a survey of publishers be conducted; 3. an expert investigator be secured; 4. there must be adequate funding; 5. there be adequate space; and, 6. that those factors be eliminated which represented the most crucial problem areas in the 1958-59 experiment. .X 63	1	988 91	1	988 92	1	988 175	1	988 246	1	988 348	1	988 389	1	988 390	1	988 429	1	988 487	1	988 502	1	988 513	1	988 579	1	988 582	1	988 588	1	988 589	1	988 596	1	988 600	1	988 601	1	988 603	1	988 613	1	988 614	1	988 618	1	988 657	1	988 685	1	988 686	1	988 691	1	988 721	1	988 722	1	988 724	1	988 725	1	988 799	1	988 805	1	988 807	1	988 825	1	988 863	1	988 864	1	988 883	1	988 930	2	988 941	1	988 950	1	988 956	1	988 958	1	988 963	1	988 978	1	988 987	5	988 988	6	988 989	1	988 997	1	988 1000	1	988 1079	1	988 1152	1	988 1208	1	988 1216	1	988 1265	1	988 1293	1	988 1294	1	988 1302	1	988 1327	1	988 1434	1	988 1434	1	988
