An Integrated, User-Oriented System for the Documentation and Control of Machine-Readable Data Files .A Byrum, John D. Jr. .A Rowen, Judith S. The purpose of this paper is to offer a solution to the problems of documentation and bibliographic control of machine-readable data files.. It is a solution which attempts to meet both the needs of the data user and the data librarian.. It is design to make readily feasible the conversion completely or in part to a computer-based operation and to tie in directly to an information retrieval system in the future.. The four elements of this documentation and control system are:standard catalogue entries, data abstract and data description forms, content documentation codebooks, and records of physical and logical characteristics of the data set.. .X 130	1	993 333	1	993 357	2	993 449	1	993 530	1	993 553	1	993 628	1	993 710	1	993 802	1	993 819	1	993 874	1	993 877	1	993 878	1	993 940	1	993 941	1	993 992	1	993 993	6	993 995	1	993 1079	1	993 1216	1	993 1421	1	993 1434	1	993 1435	1	993 1436	1	993 1436	1	993
