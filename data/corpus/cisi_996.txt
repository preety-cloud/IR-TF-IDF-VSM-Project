International Developments in Cataloging .A Anderson, Dorothy The IFLA Committee on Cataloging has been at work since 1954 to establish international standards for cataloging and bibliographic records; it was responsible for the International Conference on Cataloging Principles, Paris, 1961, and and the International Meeting of Cataloging Experts, Copenhagen, 1969.. In recent years there have been increasing demands from national cataloging bodies and bibliographic agencies for uniformity in codes and practices, and in consequence there has been more willingness to make national concessions in order to reach international standards..
